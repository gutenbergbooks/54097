    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he two old men sat
      in the library, eyeing the blue envelope that lay on the end of the long
      table nearest the fireplace, where a merry but unnoticed blaze crackled in
      the vain effort to cry down the shrieks of the bleak December wind that
      whistled about the corners of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone had come into the room&mdash;they did not know who nor when&mdash;to
      poke up the fire and to throw fresh coals into the grate. No doubt it was
      the parlourmaid. She was always doing something of the sort. It seemed to
      be her duty. Or, it might have been the housekeeper, in case the
      parlourmaid was out for the evening. Whoever it was, she certainly had
      poked up the fire, and in doing so had been compelled to push two pairs of
      feet out of the way to avoid trampling upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still they couldn't recall having seen her. For that matter, it wasn't of
      the slightest consequence. Of course, they might have poked it up
      themselves and saved her the trouble, but these ancients were not in the
      habit of doing anything that could be done by menials in the employ of Mr
      Brood. Their minds were centred upon the blue envelope that had arrived
      shortly after dinner. The fire was an old story; the blue envelope was a
      novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      From some shifting spot far out upon the broad Atlantic the contents of
      that blue envelope had come through the air, invisible, mysterious,
      uncanny. They could not understand it at all. A wireless message! It was
      the first of its kind they had seen, and they were very old men, who had
      seen everything else in the world&mdash;if one could believe their
      boastful tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had sailed the seven seas and they had traversed all the lands of the
      earth, and yet here was mystery. A man had spoken out of the air a
      thousand miles away, and his words were lying there on the end of a
      library-table, in front of a cheerful hearthstone, within reach of their
      wistful fingers; and someone had come in to poke up the fire without their
      knowledge. How could they be expected to know?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something maddening in the fact that the envelope would have to
      remain unopened until young Frederic Brood came home for the night. They
      found themselves wondering if by any chance he would fail to come in at
      all. Their hour for retiring was ten o'clock, day in, day out. As a rule
      they went to sleep about half-past eight. They seldom retired unless
      someone made the act possible by first awakening them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock on the wide mantelpiece had declared some time before, in
      ominous tones, that half-past ten had arrived, and yet they were not
      sleepy. They had not been so thoroughly wideawake in years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to half-past nine they discussed the blue envelope with every inmate of
      the house, from Mrs John Desmond, the housekeeper, down to the voiceless
      but eloquent decanter of port that stood between them, first on the arm of
      one chair, then the other. They were very old men; they could soliloquise
      without in the least disturbing each other. An observer would say, during
      these periods of abstraction, that their remarks were addressed to the
      decanter, and that the poor decanter had something to say in return. But,
      for all that, their eyes seldom left the broad blue envelope that had lain
      there since half-past eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They knew that it came directly or indirectly from the man to whom they
      owed their present condition of comfort and security after half a century
      of vicissitudes; from the man whose life they had saved more than once in
      those old, evil days when comforts were so few that they passed without
      recognition in the maelstrom of events. From mid-ocean James Brood was
      speaking to his son. His words&mdash;perhaps his cry for help&mdash;were
      lying there on the end of the table, confined in a flimsy blue envelope,
      and no one dared to liberate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic Brood deserved a thrashing for staying out so late&mdash;at
      least, so the decanter had been told a dozen times or more, and the clock,
      too, for that matter, to say nothing of the confidences reposed in the
      coal-scuttle, the fire implements, and other patient listeners of a like
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be well to state that these bosom friends and comrades of half a
      hundred years had quarrelled at seven o'clock that evening over a very
      important matter&mdash;the accuracy of individual timepieces. The watch of
      Mr Danbury Dawes had said it was five minutes before seven; that of Mr
      Joseph Riggs three minutes after. Since then neither had spoken to the
      other, but each slyly had set his watch by the big clock in the hall
      before going into dinner, and was prepared to meet any argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty years ago these two old cronies had met James Brood in one of the
      blackest holes of Calcutta, a derelict being swept to perdition with the
      swiftness and sureness of a tide that knows no pause. They found him when
      the dregs were at his lips and the stupor of defeat in his brain. Without
      meaning to be considered Samaritans, good or bad, they dragged him from
      the depths and found that they had revived <i>a man</i>. Those were the
      days when James Brood's life meant nothing to him, days when he was
      tortured by the thought that it would be all too long for him to endure;
      yet he was not the kind to murder himself as men do who lack the courage
      to go on living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks after the rescue in Calcutta, these two soldiers of fortune, and
      another John Desmond, learned from the lips of the man himself that he was
      not such as they, but rich in this world's goods, richer than the Solomon
      of their discreet imagination. Shaken, battered, but sobered, he related
      portions of his life's story to them, and they guessed the rest, being men
      who had lived by correctly guessing for half the years of their
      adventurous lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Brood they were Americans. But, unlike him, they had spent most of
      their lives in the deserts of time and had sown seeds which could never be
      reaped except in the form of narrative. Ever in pursuit of the elusive
      thing called luck, they had found it only in hairbreadth escapes from
      death, in the cunning avoidance of catastrophe, in devil-may-care leaps in
      the dark, in all the ways known to men who find the world too small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had luck served them on a golden platter. For twenty-five years and
      more these three men, Dawes, Riggs, and poor John Desmond, had thrashed
      through the world in quest of the pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow,
      only to find that the rainbow was for ever lifting, for ever shifting; yet
      they complained not. They throve on misfortune, they courted it along with
      the other things in life, and they were unhappy only when ill luck singled
      one of them out and spared the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Brood told them of his life brought the grim smile of appreciation to
      the lips of each. He had married a beautiful foreigner&mdash;an Austrian,
      they gathered&mdash;of excellent family, and had taken her to his home in
      New York City, a house in lower Fifth Avenue where his father and
      grandfather had lived before him. And that was the very house in which two
      of the wayfarers, after twenty years, now sat in rueful contemplation of a
      blue envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      A baby boy came to the Broods in the second year of their wedded life, but
      before that there had come a man&mdash;a music-master, dreamy-eyed,
      handsome, Latin; a man who played upon the harp as only the angels are
      believed to play. In his delirious ravings Brood cursed this man and the
      wife he had stolen away from him; he reviled the baby boy, even denying
      him; he laughed with blood-curdling glee over the manner in which he had
      cast out the woman who had broken his heart and crushed his pride; he
      wailed in anguish over the mistake he had made in allowing the man to live
      that he might gloat in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much the three men who lifted him from hell were able to learn from
      lips that knew not what they said, and they were filled with pity. Later
      on, in a rational weakness, he told them more, and without curses. A deep,
      silent, steadfast bitterness succeeded the violent ravings. He became a
      wayfarer with them, quiet, dogged, fatal; where they went he also went;
      what they did so also did he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he led, and they followed. Into the dark places of the world they
      plunged. Perils meant little to him, death even less. They no longer knew
      days of privation, for he shared his wealth with them; but they knew no
      rest, no peace, no safety. Life had been a whirlwind before they came upon
      James Brood; it was a hurricane afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice John Desmond, younger than Dawes and Riggs, saved the life of James
      Brood by acts of unparalleled heroism: once in a South African jungle when
      a lioness fought for her young, and again in upper India when,
      single-handed, he held off a horde of Hindus for days while his comrade
      lay wounded in a cavern. Dawes and Riggs, in the Himalayas, crept down the
      wall of a precipice, with five thousand feet between them and the bottom
      of the gorge, to drag him from a narrow ledge upon which he lay
      unconscious after a misstep in the night. More than once&mdash;aye, more
      than a dozen times&mdash;one or the other of these loyal friends stood
      between him and death, and times without number he, too, turned the grim
      reaper aside from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Desmond, gay, handsome, and still young as men of his kind go, met
      the fate that brooks no intervention. He was the first to drop out of the
      ranks. In Cairo, during a curious period of inactivity some ten months
      after the advent of James Brood, he met the woman who conquered his
      venturesome spirit; a slim, clean, pretty English governess in the employ
      of a British admiral's family. They were married inside of a fortnight.
      After the quiet little ceremony, from which the sinister presence of James
      Brood was missing, he shook the bronzed hands of his older comrades, and
      gave up the life he had led for the new one she promised. At the pier
      Brood appeared and wished him well, and he sailed away on a sea that bade
      fair to remain smooth to the end of time. He was taking her home to the
      little Maryland town that had not seen him in years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten years passed before James Brood put his foot on the soil of his native
      land. Then he came back to the home of his fathers, to the home that had
      been desecrated, and with him came the two old men who now sat in his huge
      library before the crackling fire. He could go on with life, but they were
      no longer fit for its cruel hardships. His home became theirs. They were
      to die there when the time came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood's son was fifteen years of age before he knew, even by sight, the
      man whom he called father. Up to the time of the death of his mother who
      died heart-broken in her father's home&mdash;he had been kept in
      seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been deliberate purpose in the methods of James Brood in so far
      as this unhappy child was concerned. When he cast out the mother he set
      his hand heavily upon her future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearing, even feeling, the infernal certainty that this child was not his
      own, he planned with diabolical cruelty to hurt her to the limit of his
      powers and to the end of her days. He knew she would hunger for this baby
      boy of hers, that her heart could be broken through him, that her
      punishment could be made full and complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sequestered the child in a place where he could not be found, and went
      his own way, grimly certain that he was making her pay! She died when
      Frederic was twelve years old, without having seen him again after that
      dreadful hour when, protesting her innocence, she had been turned out into
      the night and told to go whither she would, but never to return to the
      house she had disgraced. James Brood heard of her death when in the heart
      of China, and he was a haggard wreck for months thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had worshipped this beautiful Viennese. He could not wreak vengeance
      upon a dead woman; he could not hate a dead woman. He had always loved
      her. It was after this that he stood on the firing-line of many a fiercely
      fought battle in the Orient, inviting the bullet that would rip through
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not courage, but cowardice, that put him in spots where the bullets
      were thickest; it was not valour that sent him among the bayonets and
      sabres of a fanatical enemy. It was the thing at the bottom of his soul
      that told him she would come to him once more when the strife was ended,
      and that she was waiting for him somewhere beyond the border to hear his
      plea for pardon! Of such flimsy shreds is man's purpose made!
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years after his return to New York he brought her son back to the
      house in lower Fifth Avenue and tried, with bitterness in his soul, to
      endure the word &ldquo;father&rdquo; as it fell from lips to which the term was almost
      strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old men, they who sat by the fire on this wind-swept night and waited
      for the youth of twenty-two to whom the blue missive was addressed, knew
      the story of James Brood and his wife Matilde, and they knew that the
      former had no love in his heart for the youth who bore his name. Their
      lips were sealed. Garrulous on all other subjects, they were as silent as
      the grave on this.
    </p>
    <p>
      They, too, were constrained to hate the lad. He made not the slightest
      pretence of appreciating their position in the household. To him they were
      pensioners, no more, no less; to him their deeds of valour were offset by
      the deeds of his father; there was nothing left over for a balance on that
      score. He was politely considerate; he was even kindly disposed toward
      their vagaries and whims; he endured them because there was nothing else
      left for him to do. But, for all that, he despised them; justifiably, no
      doubt, if one bears in mind the fact that they signified more to James
      Brood than did his long-neglected son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold reserve that extended to the young man did not carry beyond him
      in relation to any other member of the household so far as James Brood was
      concerned. The unhappy boy, early in their acquaintance, came to realise
      that there was little in common between him and the man he called father.
      After a while the eager light died out of his own eyes and he no longer
      strove to encourage the intimate relations he had counted upon as a part
      of the recompense for so many years of separation and loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required but little effort on his part to meet his father's
      indifference with a coldness quite as pronounced. He had never known the
      meaning of filial love; he had been taught by word of mouth to love the
      man he had never seen, and he had learned as one learns astronomy&mdash;by
      calculation. He hated the two old men because his father loved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a measure, this condition may serve to show how far apart they stood
      from each other, James Brood and Frederic. Wanderlust and a certain
      feeling of unrest that went even deeper than the old habits kept James
      Brood away from his home many months out of the year. He was not an old
      man; in fact, he was under fifty, and possessed of the qualities that make
      for strength and virility even unto the age of fourscore years. While his
      old comrades, far up in the seventies, were content to sit by the fire in
      winter and in the shade in summer, he, not yet so old as they when their
      long stretch of intimacy began, was not resigned to the soft things of
      life. He was built of steel, and the steel within him called for the clash
      with flint. He loved the spark of fire that flashed in the contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a harsh December night when the two old men sat guard over the
      message from the sea, and it was on a warm June day that they had said
      good-bye to him at the outset of his most recent flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patient butler, Jones, had made no less than four visits to the
      library since ten o'clock to awaken them and pack them off to bed. Each
      time he had been ordered away, once with the joint admonition to &ldquo;mind his
      own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is nearly midnight,&rdquo; protested Jones irritably, with a glance at
      the almost empty decanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jones,&rdquo; said Danbury Dawes with great dignity and an eye that deceived
      him to such a degree that he could not for the life of him understand why
      Jones was attending them in pairs, &ldquo;Jones, you ought to be in&mdash;hic&mdash;bed,
      damn you both of you. Wha' you mean, sir, by coming in&mdash;hic&mdash;here thish time
      o' night dis-disturbing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You infernal ingrate,&rdquo; broke in Mr Riggs fiercely, &ldquo;don't you dare to
      touch that bottle, sir! Let it alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's time you were in bed,&rdquo; pronounced Jones, taking Mr Dawes by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Dawes sagged heavily in his chair and grinned triumphantly. He was a
      short, very fat old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People who live in&mdash;hic&mdash;glass houses&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began
      amiably, and then suddenly was overtaken by the thought of the moment
      before. &ldquo;Take your hand off of me, confoun' you! D' you sup-supposh I can
      go to bed with my bes' frien' out there&mdash;hic&mdash;in the mid-middle of Atlan'ic
      Oc-o-shum, sinking in four miles of wa-wa'er and calling f-far help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him to bed, Jones,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs firmly. &ldquo;He's drunk and-and
      utterly useless at a time like this. Take him along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the dev&mdash;hic&mdash;il are you, sir?&rdquo; demanded Mr Dawes, regarding Mr Riggs
      as if he had never seen him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are both drunk,&rdquo; said Jones succinctly. Mr Riggs began to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bes' frien' is drawnin' by inches, and you come in here and tell me
      I'm drunk. It's most heartless thing I ever heard of. Isn't it, Danbury,
      ol' pal? Isn't it, damn you? Speak up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drawnin' by inches&mdash;hic&mdash;in four miles of wa-water,&rdquo; admitted Mr Dawes
      miserably. &ldquo;My God, Jo-Jones, do you know how many&mdash;hic&mdash;inches there
      are in four miles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moved by the same impulse, the two old men struggled to their feet and
      embraced each other, swayed by an emotion so honest that all sense of the
      ludicrous was removed. Even Jones, though he grinned, allowed a note of
      gentleness to creep into his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, gentlemen, like good fellows. Let's go to bed. I'm sure the
      message to Mr Frederic is not as bad as you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Riggs, who was head and shoulders taller than Mr Dawes, made a gesture
      of despair with both arms, forgetting that they encircled his friend's
      neck, with the result that both of his bony elbows came in violent contact
      with Mr Dawes's ears, almost upsetting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't argue, Jones,&rdquo; he interrupted dismally. &ldquo;I know it's bad news. So
      does Mr Dawes. Don't you, Danbury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d' you mean by&mdash;hic&mdash;knockin' my hat off?&rdquo; demanded Mr Dawes
      furiously, shaking his fist at Mr Riggs from rather close quarters&mdash;so
      close, in fact, that Mr Riggs suddenly clapped his hands to his stomach
      and emitted a surprised groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones inserted his figure between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, gentlemen; don't forget yourselves. What now, Mr Riggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm lookin' for the gentleman's hat, sir,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs impressively
      from a stooping posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His hat is on the rack in the hall,&rdquo; said Jones sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shan't ex-expect an&mdash;hic&mdash;'pology,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes magnanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Riggs opened his mouth to retort, but as he did so his eyes fell upon
      the blue envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Jim&mdash;poor old Jim Brood!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;We mustn't lose a
      minute, Danbury. He needs us, old pal. We must start relief exp'ition'
      fore mornin'. Not a minute to be lost, Jones&mdash;not a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy front door closed with a bang at that instant, and the sound of
      footsteps, came from the hall&mdash;a quick, firm tread that had decision
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones cast a furtive, nervous glance over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to have Mr Frederic see you like this,&rdquo; he said, biting his
      lip. &ldquo;He hates it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two old men made a commendable effort to stand erect, but no effort to
      stand alone. They linked arms and stood shoulder to shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him in,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs magnificently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we'll fin' out wass in telegram off briny deep,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes,
      straddling his legs a little farther apart in order to declare a staunch
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's worth waiting up for,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abs'lutely,&rdquo; said his staunch friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic Brood appeared in the door, stopping short just inside the heavy
      curtains. There was a momentary picture, such as a stage-director would
      have arranged. He was still wearing his silk hat and top-coat, and one
      glove had been halted in the process of removal. Young Brood stared at the
      group of three, a frank stare of amazement. A crooked smile came to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhat later than usual, I see,&rdquo; he said, and the glove came off with a
      jerk. &ldquo;What's the matter, Jones? Rebellion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. It's the wireless, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wireless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Briny deep,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes, vaguely pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said young Brood, crossing slowly to the table. He picked up the
      envelope and looked at the inscription. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he again in quite a
      different tone on seeing that it was addressed to him. &ldquo;From father, I
      dare say,&rdquo; he went on, a fine line appearing between his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old men leaned forward, fixing their blear eyes upon the missive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le's hear the worst, Freddy,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man ran his finger under the flap and deliberately drew out the
      message. There ensued another picture. As he read, his eyes widened and
      then contracted; his firm young jaw became set and rigid. Suddenly a
      short, bitter execration fell from his lips and the paper crumpled in his
      hand. Without another word he strode to the fireplace and tossed it upon
      the coals. It flared for a second and was wafted up the chimney, a
      charred, feathery thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without deigning to notice the two old men who had sat up half the night
      to learn the contents of that wonderful thing from the sea, he whirled on
      his heel and left the room. One might have noticed that his lips were
      drawn in a mirthless, sardonic smile, and that his eyes were angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lordy!&rdquo; sighed Danbury Dawes, blinking, and was on the point of
      sitting down abruptly. The arm of Jones prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was so insulted in my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
      Joseph Riggs feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Jones. &ldquo;Lean on me, please.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ames Brood's home
      was a remarkable one. That portion of the house which rightly may be
      described as &ldquo;public&rdquo; in order to distinguish it from other parts where
      privacy was enforced, was not unlike any of the richly furnished,
      old-fashioned places in the lower part of the city where there are still
      traces left of the Knickerbockers and their times. Dignified, stately,
      almost gloomy, it was a mansion in which memories dwelt, where the past
      strode unseen among sturdy things of mahogany and walnut and worn but
      priceless brocades and silks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystal chandelier in the long drawing-room had shed light for the
      Broods since the beginning of the nineteenth century; the great old
      sideboard was still covered with the massive plate of a hundred years ago;
      the tables, the chairs, the high-boys, the chests of drawers, and the huge
      four-posters were like satin to the eye and touch; the rugs, while older
      perhaps than the city itself, alone were new to the house of Brood. They
      had been installed by the present master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Age, distinction, quality attended one the instant he set foot inside the
      sober portals. This was not the home of men who had been merely rich; it
      was not wealth alone that stood behind these stately investments.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the house were the rooms which no one entered except by the
      gracious will of the master. Here James Brood had stored the quaint,
      priceless treasures of his own peculiar fancy: exquisite, curious things
      from the mystic East, things that are not to be bought and sold, but come
      only to the hand of him who searches in lands where peril is the price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worlds separated the upper and lower regions of that fine old house; a
      single step took one from the sedate Occident into the very heart of the
      Orient; a narrow threshold was the line between the rugged West and the
      soft, languorous, seductive East. In this part of the house James Brood,
      when at home for one of his brief stays, spent many of his hours in
      seclusion, shut off from the rest of the establishment as completely as if
      he were the inhabitant of another world. Attended by his Hindu servant, a
      silent man named Ranjab, and on occasions by his secretary, he saw but
      little of the remaining members of his rather extensive household.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several years he had been engaged in the task of writing his memoirs&mdash;so-called&mdash;in
      so far as they related to his experiences and researches of the past
      twenty years. It was not his intention to give this long and elaborate
      account of himself to the world at large, but to publish privately a very
      limited edition without regard for expense, copies of which were to find
      their way into exclusive collections and libraries given over to science
      and travel. This work progressed slowly because of his frequent and
      protracted absences. When at home, he laboured ardently and with a purpose
      that more than offset the periods of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      His secretary and amanuensis was Lydia Desmond, the nineteen-year-old
      daughter of his one-time companion and friend, the late John Desmond, whose
      death occurred when the girl was barely ten years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood, on hearing of his old comrade's decease, immediately made inquiries
      concerning the condition in which he had left his wife and child, with the
      result that Mrs Desmond was installed as housekeeper in the New York house
      and the daughter given every advantage in the way of an education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desmond had left nothing in the shape of riches except undiminished love
      for his wife and a diary kept during those perilous days before he met and
      married her. This diary was being incorporated in the history of James
      Brood's adventures, by consent of the widow, and was to speak for Brood in
      words he could not with modesty utter for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those pages John Desmond was to tell his own story in his own way, for
      Brood's love for his friend was broad enough even to admit of that. He was
      to share his life in retrospect with Desmond and the two old men, as he
      had shared it with them in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia's room, adjoining her mother's, was on the third floor at the foot
      of the small stairway leading up to the proscribed retreat at the top of
      the house. There was a small sitting-room off the two bed-chambers, given
      over entirely to Mrs Desmond and her daughter. In this little room
      Frederic Brood spent many a quiet, happy hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Desmonds, mother and daughter, understood and pitied the lonely boy
      who came to the big house soon after they were themselves installed. His
      heart, which had many sores, expanded and glowed in the warmth of their
      kindness and affection; the plague of unfriendliness that was his by
      absorption gave way before this unexpected kindness, not immediately, it
      is true, but completely in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      By nature he was slow to respond to the advances of others; his life had
      been such that avarice accounted for all that he received from others in
      the shape of respect and consideration. He was prone to discount a
      friendly attitude, for the simple reason that in his experience all
      friendships were marred by the fact that their sincerity rested entirely
      upon the generosity of the man who paid for them&mdash;his father. No one
      had loved him for himself; no one had given him an unselfish thought in
      all the years of his boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family with whom he had lived in a curious sort of retirement up to
      the time he was fifteen had no real feeling for him beyond the bounds of
      duty; his tutors had taken their pay in exchange for all they gave; his
      companions were men and women who dealt with him as one deals with a
      precious investment. He represented ease and prosperity to them&mdash;no
      more. As he grew older he understood all this. What warmth there may have
      been in his little heart was chilled by contact with these sordid
      influences.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he held himself aloof from the Desmonds; he was slow to
      surrender. He suspected them of the same motives that had been the basis
      of all previous attachments. When at last he realised that they were not
      like the others, his cup of joy, long an empty vessel, was filled to the
      brim and his happiness was without bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were amazed by the transformation. The rather sullen, unapproachable
      lad became at once so friendly, so dependent, that, had they not been
      acquainted with the causes behind the old state of reticence, his very joy
      might have made a 
      nuisance of him. He followed Mrs Desmond
      about in very much the same spirit that inspires a
      hungry dog; he watched her with eager, half-famished eyes; he was on her
      heels four-fifths of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Lydia, pretty little Lydia, he adored her. His heart began for the
      first time to sing with the joy of youth, and the sensation was a novel
      one. It had seemed to him that he could never be anything but an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a day passed during his career at Harvard that he failed to write to
      one or other of these precious friends. His vacations were spent with
      them; his excursions were never carried out unless they found it possible
      to accompany him. He followed Mrs Desmond, met many
      women, but he thought of only two. They appeared to constitute all
      femininity so far as he was concerned. Through their awakening influence
      he came to find pleasure in the companionship of other young men, and, be
      it said for him, despite a certain unconquerable aloofness, he was one of
      the most popular men in his class.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his custom, on coming home for the night, no matter what the hour,
      to pause before Lydia's door on the way to his own room at the other end
      of the long hall. There was always a tender smile on his lips as he
      regarded the white panels before tapping gently with the tips of his
      fingers. Then he would wait for the sleepy &ldquo;Good night, Freddy,&rdquo; which
      invariably came from within, and he would sing out &ldquo;Good night&rdquo; as he made
      off to bed. Usually, however, he was at home long before her bedtime, and
      they spent the evenings together. That she was his father's secretary was
      of no moment. To him she was Lydia&mdash;his Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past three months or more he had been privileged to hold her close
      in his arms and to kiss her good night at parting. They were lovers now.
      The slow fuse of passion had reached its end and the flame was alive and
      shining with radiance that enveloped both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this night, however, he passed her door without knocking. His dark,
      handsome face was flushed and his teeth were set in sullen anger. With his
      hand on the knob of his own door, he suddenly remembered that he had
      failed Lydia for the first time, and stopped. A pang of shame shot through
      him. For a moment he hesitated and then started guiltily toward the
      forgotten door. Even as he raised his hand to sound the loving signal, the
      door was opened and Lydia, fully dressed, confronted him. For a moment
      they regarded each other in silence, she intently, he with astonishment
      not quite free from confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm&mdash;I'm sorry, dearest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, his first desire
      being to account for his oversight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> bad news?&rdquo; she demanded, anxiously watching his face. &ldquo;I was
      afraid, dear. I couldn't go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, too?&rdquo; he exclaimed bitterly. &ldquo;The old chaps&mdash;but it's a shame
      for you to have waited up, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what has happened. It can't be that your father is ill&mdash;or
      in danger. You are angry, Frederic; so it can't be that. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked away sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's really nothing, I suppose. Just an unexpected jolt, that's all.
      I was angry for a moment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still angry,&rdquo; she said, placing her hand on his arm. She was a
      tall, slender girl. Her eyes were almost on a level with his own. &ldquo;Don't
      you want to tell me, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never gives me a thought,&rdquo; he said, compressing his lips. &ldquo;He thinks
      of no one but himself. God, what a father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddy, dear! You must not speak&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I some claim on his consideration? Is it fair that I should be
      ignored in everything, in every way? I won't put up with it, Lydia! I'm
      not a child. I'm a man and I am his son. But I might as well be a dog in
      the street for all the thought he gives to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her finger to her lips, a scared look stealing into her dark eyes.
      Jones was conducting the two old men to their room on the floor below. A
      door closed softly. The voices died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a strange man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is a good man, Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To everyone else, yes. But to me? Why, Lydia, I&mdash;I believe he hates
      me. You know what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! A man does not hate his son. I've tried for years to drive that
      silly notion out of your mind. You&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know I'm a fool to speak of it, but I&mdash;I can't help feeling as
      I do. You've seen enough to know that I'm not to blame for it, either. And
      then&mdash;oh, what's the use whining about it? I've got to make the best
      of it, so I'll try to keep my mouth closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I threw it into the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was furious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think he has done? Can you guess what he has done to all of
      us?&rdquo; She did not answer. &ldquo;Well, I'll tell you just what he said in that
      wireless. It was from the <i>Lusitania</i>, twelve hundred miles off
      Sandy Hook&mdash;relayed, I suppose, so that the whole world might know&mdash;sent
      at four this afternoon. I remember every word of the cursed thing,
      although I merely glanced at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Send the car to meet Mrs Brood and me at the Cunard pier Thursday. Have
      Mrs Desmond put the house in order for its new mistress. By the way, you
      might inform her that I was married last Wednesday in Paris.' It was
      signed 'James Brood,' not even 'father.' What do you think of that for a
      thunderbolt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Your father married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Put the house in order for its new mistress,'&rdquo; he almost snarled.
      &ldquo;'Inform her that I was married last Wednesday'! Of course he's married.
      Am I not to inform your mother? Isn't the car to meet Mrs Brood and him?
      Does he say anything about his son meeting him at the pier? No! Does he
      cable his son that he is married? No! Does he do anything that a real,
      human father would do? No! That message was a deliberate insult to me,
      Lydia, a nasty, rotten slap in the face. I mean the way it was worded.
      Just as if it wasn't enough that he had gone and married some cheap
      show-girl or a miserable foreigner or Heaven knows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddy! You forget yourself. Your father would not marry a cheap
      show-girl. You know that. And you must not forget that your mother was a
      foreigner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry I said that,&rdquo; he exclaimed hoarsely. Then fiercely: &ldquo;But can't
      you see what all this will come to? A new mistress of the house! It means
      your mother will have to go&mdash;that maybe you'll go. Nothing will be as
      it has been. All the sweetness gone&mdash;all the goodness! A woman in the
      house who will also treat me as if I didn't belong here! A woman who
      married him for his money, an adventuress. Oh, you can't tell me; I know!
      'You might inform Mrs Desmond that I was married'! Good Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to pace the floor, striking one fist viciously in the palm of the
      other hand. Lydia, pale and trembling, seemed to have forgotten his
      presence. She was staring fixedly at the white surface of a door down the
      hall, and there was infinite pain in her wide eyes. Her lips moved once or
      twice; there was a single unspoken word upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn't he have wired me last week?&rdquo; the young man was muttering.
      &ldquo;What was his object in waiting until to-day? Wouldn't any other father in
      the world have telegraphed his only son if he were going to&mdash;to bring
      someone home like this? 'Have the car meet Mrs Brood and me'! If that
      isn't the quintessence of scorn! He orders me to do these things. He
      doesn't even honour me with a direct, personal message. He doesn't tell <i>me</i>
      he is married. He asks me to inform someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia, leaning rather heavily against the door, spoke to him in a low,
      cautious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell Mr Dawes and Mr Riggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! And they waited up to see if they could be of any assistance to him
      in an hour of peril! What a joke! Poor old beggars! I've never felt sorry
      for them before, but, on my soul, I do now. What will she do to the poor
      old chaps? I shudder to think of it. And she'll make short work of
      everything else she doesn't like around here, too. Your mother, Lydia&mdash;why,
      God help us, you know what will just have to happen in her case. It's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't speak so loudly, dear&mdash;please, please! She is asleep. Of
      course, we&mdash;we shan't stay on, Freddy. We'll have to go as soon as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes filled with tears. He seized her in his arms and held her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a beastly, beastly shame, darling. Oh, Lord, what a fool a man can
      make of himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not say such things,&rdquo; she murmured, stroking his cheek with
      cold, trembling fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine trick to play on all of us!&rdquo; he grated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Freddy darling: your father has a right to do as he chooses. He
      has a right to companionship, to love, to happiness. He has done
      everything for us that man could&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why couldn't he have done the fine, sensible thing, Lydia? Why
      couldn't he have&mdash;have fallen in love with&mdash;with your mother?
      Why not have married her if he had to marry someone in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddy!&rdquo; she cried, putting her hand over his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not to be stopped. He gently removed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother is the finest woman in the world. Perhaps she wouldn't have
      him, but that's not the point. Good Lord, how I would have loved him for
      giving her to me as a mother. And here he comes, bringing some devil of a
      stranger into&mdash;oh, it's sickening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper, keeping his eyes fixed on
      the door down the hall. The girl lay very still in his arms. Suddenly a
      wild sob broke in her throat, and she buried her face on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, don't cry, dearest! Don't!&rdquo; he whispered miserably. &ldquo;What
      a rotter I am! Inflicting you with my silly imaginings! Don't cry! I dare
      say everything will turn out all right. It's my beastly disposition. Kiss
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him swiftly. Her wet cheek lay for a second against his own,
      and then, with a stifled good night, she broke away from him. An instant
      later she was gone; her door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat sobered, and not a little perturbed by her outburst, he stood
      still for a moment, staring at the door. Then he turned and passed slowly
      into his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fire smouldered in the grate. In this huge, old-fashioned house there
      were grates in all of the spacious bedrooms, and not infrequently fires
      were started in them by the capable Jones. Frederic stood for he knew not
      how long above the half-dead coals, staring at them with a new and more
      bitter complaint at the back of his mind. Was there anything between Mrs
      Desmond and his father? What was back of that look of anguish in Lydia's
      eyes? He suddenly realised that he was muttering oaths, not of anger, but
      of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he came down earlier than was his custom. His night had
      been a troubled one. Forgetting his own woes, or belittling them, he had
      thought only of what this news from the sea would mean to the dear woman
      he loved so well. No one was in the library, but a huge fire was blazing.
      A blizzard was raging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, when he first came to the house, a piano had stood in
      the drawing-room. His joy at that time knew no bounds; he loved music. For
      his age he was no mean musician. But one evening his father, coming in
      unexpectedly, heard the player at the instrument. For a moment he stood
      transfixed in the doorway watching the eager, almost inspired face of the
      lad, and then, pale as a ghost, stole away without disturbing him. Strange
      to say, Frederic was playing a waltz of Ziehrer's, a Waltz that his mother
      had played when the honeymoon was in the full. The following day the piano
      was taken away by a storage company. The boy never knew why it was
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic picked up the morning paper. His eye traversed the front page
      rapidly. There were reports of fearful weather at sea. Ships in touch with
      wireless stations flashed news of the riotous gales far out on the
      Atlantic, of tremendous seas that wreaked damage to the staunchest of
      vessels. The whole seaboard was strewn with the wreckage of small craft; a
      score of vessels were known to be ashore and in grave peril. The movement
      of passenger-vessels, at the bottom of the page, riveted his attention.
      The <i>Lusitania</i> was reported seven hundred miles out, and in the
      heart of the hurricane. She would be a day late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper was slightly crumpled, as if someone else had read it before
      him. He found himself wondering how he would feel if the <i>Lusitania</i>
      never reached New York! He wondered what his sensations would be if a call
      for help came from the great vessel, if the dreadful news came that she
      was sinking with all on board!
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up from the paper with what actually seemed to him to be a
      guilty feeling. Someone had entered the room. Mrs Desmond was coming
      toward him, a queer little smile on her lips. She was a tall, fair woman,
      an English type, and still extremely handsome. Hers was an honest beauty
      that had no fear of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a staunch ship, Frederic,&rdquo; she said, without any other form of
      greeting. &ldquo;She will be late, but there's really nothing to worry about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not worrying,&rdquo; he said confusedly. &ldquo;Lydia has told you the&mdash;the
      news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather staggering, isn't it?&rdquo; he said with a wry smile. In spite of
      himself he watched her face with curious intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; she said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was instructed to inform you that he was married last Wednesday,&rdquo; he
      said, and his face hardened. &ldquo;And to have the car meet them at the dock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be necessary, Frederic. I have given Jones his instructions. You
      will not even have to carry out the orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don't approve of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know just how you feel, poor boy. Don't try to explain. I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always understand,&rdquo; he said, lowering his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; she said quietly. There was something cryptic in the remark.
      He kept his eyes averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's going to play hob with everything,&rdquo; he said, jamming his hands
      deep into his pockets. His shoulders seemed to hunch forward and to
      contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am especially sorry for Mr Dawes and Mr Riggs,&rdquo; she said. Her voice was
      steady and full of earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were up and about at daybreak, poor souls. Do you know, Freddy, they
      were starting off in this blizzard when I met them in the hall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! I&mdash;I hope it wasn't on account of anything I may have
      said to them last night,&rdquo; he cried in contrition.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;No. They had their own theory about the message. The storm
      strengthened it. They were positive that your father was in great peril. I
      don't like to tell you this, but they seemed to think that you couldn't be
      depended upon to take a hand in&mdash;in&mdash;well, in helping him. They
      were determined to charter a vessel of some sort and start off in all this
      blizzard to search the sea for Mr Brood. Oh, aren't they wonderful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had no feeling of resentment toward the old men for their opinion of
      him. Instead, his eyes glowed with an honest admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, Mrs Desmond, they <i>are</i> great! They are <i>men</i>, bless
      their hearts. Seventy-five years old and still ready to face anything for
      a comrade! It <i>does</i> prove something, doesn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It proves that your father has made no mistake in selecting his friends,
      my dear. My husband used to say that he would cheerfully die for James
      Brood, and he knew that James Brood would have died for him just as
      readily. There is something in friendships of that sort that we can't
      understand. We never have been able to test our friends, much less
      ourselves. We&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would die for you, Mrs Desmond,&rdquo; cried Frederic, a deep flush
      overspreading his face. &ldquo;For you and Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come by that naturally,&rdquo; she said, laying her hand upon his arm.
      &ldquo;Blood will tell. Thank you, Frederic.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;I am sure it will not
      be necessary for you to die for me, however. As for Lydia, you must live,
      not die, for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do both,&rdquo; he cried impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you go in to breakfast I want to say something else to you,
      Frederic,&rdquo; said she seriously. &ldquo;Lydia has repeated everything you said to
      her last night. My dear boy, my husband has been dead for twelve years. I
      loved him, and he died loving me. I shall never marry another man. I am
      still the wife of John Desmond; I still consider myself bound to him. Can
      you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talked like a lunatic last night, I fear,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;I might have
      known. You, too, belong to the list of loyal ones. Forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to forgive, dear,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;And now, one more
      word, Frederic. You must accept this new condition of affairs in the right
      spirit. Your father has married again, after all these years. It is not
      likely that he has done so without deliberation. Therefore, it is
      reasonable to assume that he is bringing home with him a wife of whom he
      at least is proud, and that should weigh considerably in your summing up
      of the situation. She will be beautiful, accomplished, refined, and good,
      Frederic. Of that you may be sure. Let me implore you to withhold judgment
      until a later day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not object to the situation, Mrs Desmond,&rdquo; said he, the angry light
      returning to his eyes, &ldquo;so much as I resent the wording of that telegram.
      It is always just that way. He loses no chance to humiliate me. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! You are losing your temper again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who wouldn't? And here's another thing, the very worst of all. How
      is this new condition going to affect you, Mrs Desmond?&rdquo; She was silent
      for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I shan't stay on here, Frederic. I shall not be needed now. As
      soon as Mrs Brood is settled here I shall go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you expect me to be cheerful and contented!&rdquo; he cried bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man, Frederic. It is for you to say yea and nay; women must say
      one or the other. A man may make his own bed, but he doesn't always have
      to lie in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds rather like Solomon,&rdquo; he said ruefully. &ldquo;I suppose you mean that
      if I'm not contented here I ought to get out and look for happiness
      elsewhere, reserving the right to come back if I fail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of the sort,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father objects to my going into business or taking up a profession. I
      am dependent on him for everything. But why go into that? We've talked it
      over a thousand times. I don't understand, but perhaps you do. It's a
      dog's way of living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father is making a man of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is, eh?&rdquo; with great scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He will make you see some day that the kind of life you lead is not
      the kind you want. Your pride, your ambition will rebel. Then you will
      make something out of life for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think that is in his mind, if you'll pardon me. I sometimes
      believe he actually wants me to stay as I am, always a dependent. Why, how
      can he expect me to marry and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short, his face
      paling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it looks to me as if he means to make it impossible for me to
      marry, Mrs Desmond. I've thought of it a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it impossible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I shall marry Lydia, even though I have to dig in the streets for
      her. It isn't that, however. There's some other reason back of his
      attitude, but for the life of me I can't get at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't try to get at it, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Wait and see. Come, you
      must have your coffee. I am glad you came down early. The old gentlemen
      are at breakfast now. Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her dejectedly, a droop to his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Dawes and Mr Riggs were seated at the table. Lydia, a trifle pale and
      distrait, was pouring their third cup of coffee. The old men showed no
      sign of their midnight experience. They were very wideawake, clear-eyed,
      and alert, as old men will be who do not count the years of life left in
      the span appointed for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Freddy,&rdquo; said they, almost in one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed behind their chairs on his way to Lydia's side, he slapped
      each of them cordially on the back. They seemed to swell with relief and
      gratitude. He was not in the habit of slapping them on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he. Then he lifted Lydia's slim fingers to
      his lips. &ldquo;Good morning, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She squeezed his fingers tightly and smiled. A look of relief leaped into
      her eyes; she drew a long breath. She poured his coffee for him every
      morning. Her hand shook a little as she lifted the tiny cream-pitcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't sleep very well,&rdquo; she explained in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand rested on her shoulder for a moment in a gentle caress. Then he
      sat down in the chair Jones had drawn out for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, when does the relief boat start?&rdquo; he asked, with a
      forced attempt at humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Dawes regarded him with great solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddy, it's too late. A man can be saved from the scourge, tigers,
      elephants, lions, snakes, and almost everything else in God's world, but,
      blast me, he can't be protected against women! They are deadly. They can
      overpower the strongest of men, sir. Your poor father is lost for ever. I
      never was so sorry for anyone in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had only called for help a week or so ago, we could have saved
      him,&rdquo; lamented Mr Riggs. &ldquo;But he never even peeped. Lordy, Lordy, and just
      think of it, he yelled like an Indian when that lion leaped on him at
      Nairobi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Jim!&rdquo; sighed Mr Dawes. &ldquo;He'll probably have to ask us to pull
      out, too. I imagine she'll insist on making a spare bedroom out of our
      room, so's she can entertain all of her infernal relations. Jones, will
      you give me some more bacon and another egg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought it was nothing but a shipwreck,&rdquo; murmured Mr Riggs
      plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic hurried through breakfast. Lydia followed him into the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going out, dear?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I've got to do something. I can't sit still and think of what's
      going to happen. I'll be back for luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later he was in the small bachelor apartment of two college
      friends, a few blocks farther up-town, and he was doing the thing he did
      nearly every day of his life in a surreptitious way. He sat at the cheap
      upright piano in their disordered living-room and, unhampered by the
      presence of young men who preferred music as it is rendered for the
      masses, played as if his very soul was in his fingers.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next three or
      four days passed slowly for those who waited. A spirit of uneasiness
      pervaded the household. Among the servants, from Jones down, there was
      dismay. It was not even remotely probable that Mrs Desmond would remain,
      and they confessed to a certain affection for her, strange as it may
      appear to those who know the traits of servants who have been well treated
      by those above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic flatly refused to meet the steamer when she docked. As if swayed
      by his decision, Dawes and Riggs likewise abandoned a plan to greet the
      returning master and his bride as they came down the gangplank. But for
      the almost peremptory counsel of Mrs Desmond, Brood's son would have
      absented himself from the house on the day of their arrival. Jones and a
      footman went to the pier with the chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half-past two in the afternoon when the automobile drew up in front
      of the house and the fur-coated footman nimbly hopped down and threw open
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Brood, a tall, distinguished-looking man of fifty, stepped out of
      the limousine. For an instant, before turning to assist his wife from the
      car, he allowed his keen eyes to sweep the windows on the lower floor. In
      one of them stood his son, holding the lace curtains apart and smiling a
      welcome that seemed sincere. He waved his hand to the man on the
      side-walk. Brood responded with a swift, almost perfunctory gesture, and
      then held out his hand to the woman who was descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic's intense gaze was fixed on the stranger who was coming into his
      life. At a word from Brood she glanced up at the window. The smile still
      lingered on the young man's lips, but his eyes were charged with an
      expression of acute wonder. She smiled, but he was scarcely aware of the
      fact. He watched them cross the side-walk and mount the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never looked upon a more beautiful creature in all his life. A kind
      of stupefaction held him motionless until he heard the door close behind
      them. In that brief interval a picture had been impressed upon his senses
      that was to last for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was slightly above the medium height, slender and graceful even in the
      long, thick coat that enveloped her. She did not wear a veil. He had a
      swift but enduring glimpse of dark, lustrous eyes; of long lashes that
      drooped; of a curiously pallid, perfectly modelled face; of red lips and
      very white teeth; of jet-black hair parted above a broad, clear brow to
      curtain the temple and ear; of a firm, sensitive chin. Somehow he received
      the extraordinary impression that the slim, lithe body was never cold;
      that she expressed in some indefinable way the unvarying temperature of
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried into the hall, driven by the spur of duty. They were crossing
      the vestibule. Jones, who had preceded them in a taxicab, was holding open
      the great hall door. Dawes and Higgs, shivering quite as much with
      excitement as from the chilly blast that swept in through the storm-doors,
      occupied a point of vantage directly behind the butler. They suggested a
      reception committee. Frederic was obliged to remain in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard his father's warm, almost gay response to the greetings of the
      old men, whose hands he wrung with fervour that was unmistakable. He heard
      him present them to the new Mrs Brood as &ldquo;the best old boys in all the
      world,&rdquo; and they were both saying, with spasmodic cackles of pleasure,
      that she &ldquo;mustn't believe a word the young rascal said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was struck by the calm, serene manner in which she accepted these
      jocular contributions to the occasion. Her smile was friendly, her
      handshake cordial, and yet there was an unmistakable air of tolerance, as
      of one who is accustomed to tribute. The rather noisy acclamations of the
      old adventurers brought no flush of embarrassment to her cheek; not the
      flicker of an eyelid, nor a protesting word or frown. She merely smiled
      and thanked them in simple, commonplace phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic, who was given to forming swift impressions, most of which sprang
      from his own varying moods and were seldom permanent, formed an instant
      and rather startling opinion of the newcomer. She was either a remarkable
      actress or a woman whose previous station in life had been far more
      exalted than the one she now approached. He had an absurd notion that he
      might be looking upon a person of noble birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was low-pitched and marked by huskiness that was peculiar in
      that it was musical, not throaty. Frederic, on first seeing her, had
      leaped to the conclusion that her English would not be perfect. He was
      somewhat surprised to discover that she had but the faintest trace of an
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exchange of greetings at the door seemed to him unnecessarily
      prolonged. He stood somewhat apart from the little circle, uncomfortable
      and distinctly annoyed with the old men who, in their garrulous gallantry,
      blocked the way in both directions. He awoke suddenly, however, to the
      realisation that he had been looking into his new stepmother's eyes for a
      long time and that she was returning his gaze with some intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this?&rdquo; she said, abruptly breaking in upon one of Danbury's hasty
      reminiscences, effectually ending it. &ldquo;This is Frederic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came directly toward the young man, her small, gloved hand extended.
      Her eyes were looking into his with an intentness that disconcerted him.
      There was no smile on her lips. It was as if she regarded this moment as a
      pronounced crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic mumbled something fatuous about being glad to see her, and felt
      his face burn under her steady gaze. His father came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; this is Frederic, my dear,&rdquo; he said, without a trace of warmth in
      his voice. As she withdrew her hand from Frederic's clasp James Brood
      extended his. &ldquo;How are you, Frederic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands in the most perfunctory manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not ask how you are, father,&rdquo; said the son, after an instant's
      hesitation. &ldquo;You never looked better, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I <i>am</i> well. Ah, Mrs Desmond! It is good to be home again
      with you all. My dear, permit me to introduce Mrs John Desmond. You have
      heard me speak of my old comrade and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard you speak of Mr Desmond a thousand times,&rdquo; said his wife.
      There may have been a shade of emphasis on the prefix, but it was so
      slight that no one remarked it save the widow of John Desmond, who had
      joined the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best pal a man ever had,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes with conviction. &ldquo;Wasn't he,
      Riggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs loudly, as if expecting someone to dispute it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go to your room at once, Mrs Brood?&rdquo; asked Mrs Desmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new mistress of the house had not offered to shake hands with her, as
      James Brood had done. She had moved closer to Frederic and was smiling in
      a rather shy, pleading way, in direct contrast to her manner of the moment
      before. The smile was for her stepson. She barely glanced at Mrs Desmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no. I see a nice big fire, and&mdash;oh, I have been so cold!&rdquo;
       She shivered very prettily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; cried her husband. &ldquo;That's just the thing.&rdquo; No one spoke as they
      moved toward the library. &ldquo;We must try to thaw out,&rdquo; he added dryly, with
      a faint smile on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife laid her hand on Frederic's arm. &ldquo;It is cold outside, Frederic,&rdquo;
       she said; &ldquo;very cold. I am not accustomed to the cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If anyone had told him beforehand that his convictions, or his prejudices,
      could be overthrown in the twinkling of an eye, he would have laughed him
      to scorn. He was prepared to dislike her. He was determined that his hand
      should be against her in the conflict that was bound to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in a flash, his incomprehensible heart proved treacherous. She
      had touched some secret spring in the bottom of it, and a strange, new
      emotion rushed up within him, like the flood which finds a new channel and
      will not be denied by mortal ingenuity. A queer, wistful note of sympathy
      in her voice had done the trick. Something in the touch of her fingers on
      his arm completed the mystery. He was conscious of a mighty surge of
      relief. The horizon cleared for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall do our best to keep you warm,&rdquo; he said quite gaily, and was
      somewhat astonished at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had preceded the others into the library. James Brood was divesting
      himself of his coat in the hall, attended by the leechlike old men. Mrs
      Desmond stood in the doorway, a detached figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must love me, Frederic. You must be very, very fond of me, not for
      your father's sake, but for mine. Then we shall be great friends, not
      antagonists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was helping her with her coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I looked forward to you with a good deal of animosity,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was quite natural,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;A stepmother is not of one's own
      choosing, as a rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's usually resented,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall not be a stepmother,&rdquo; she said quickly. Her eyes were serious
      for an instant, then filled with a luminous smile. &ldquo;I shall be Yvonne to
      you, and you Frederic to me. Let it be a good beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are splendid,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It's not going to be at all bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you will like me,&rdquo; she said composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood joined them at the fireside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, Mrs Desmond will show you over the house when you are ready. You
      will be interested in seeing the old place. Later on I shall take you up
      to my secret hiding-place, as they say in books. Ranjab will have the
      rooms in order by this evening. Where is your daughter, Mrs Desmond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is at work on the catalogue, Mr Brood, in the jade room. In your last
      letter you instructed her to finish that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is a holiday, Mrs Desmond,&rdquo; said he, frowning. &ldquo;Jones, will you
      ask Miss Lydia to join us for tea at half-past four?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will adore Lydia,&rdquo; said Frederic to Mrs Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently she did not hear him, for she gave no sign. She was looking
      about the room with eyes that seemed to take in everything. For the moment
      her interest appeared to be centred on the inanimate, to the complete
      exclusion of all other objects. Frederic had the odd notion that she was
      appraising her new home with the most calculating of minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he watched her he was struck by the subtle change that came into
      her dark eyes. It lingered for the briefest moment, but the impression he
      got was lasting. There was something like dread in the far-away look that
      settled for a few seconds and then lifted. She caught him looking at her,
      and smiled once more, but nervously. Then her glance went swiftly to the
      face of James Brood, who was listening to something that Mrs Desmond was
      saying. It rested there for a short but intense scrutiny, and the smile
      began to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I shall be very happy in this dear old house,&rdquo; she said
      quietly. &ldquo;Your own mother must have loved it, Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      James Brood started. Unnoticed by the others, his fingers tightened on the
      gloves he carried in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew my mother,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;She died when I was a
      baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course this was her home, was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Frederic uncomfortably. &ldquo;I suppose so. I&mdash;I came
      here a few years ago, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even though you never knew her, there must still be something here
      that&mdash;that&mdash;how shall I say it? I mean, you must feel that she
      and you were here together years and years ago. One may never have seen
      his mother, yet he can always feel her. There is something&mdash;shall I
      say spiritual, in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband broke in upon these unwelcome reflections. His voice was
      curiously harsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs Desmond is waiting, Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in such great haste, Mrs Desmond?&rdquo; she asked in a voice that cut
      like a knife. Instinctively she glanced at Frederic's face. She saw the
      muscles of the jaw harden and an angry light leap into his eyes. Instantly
      her arrogance fell away. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mrs Desmond. I have many bad
      habits. Now will you kindly show me to my room? I prefer that you and not
      one of the servants should be my guide. <i>Au revoir</i>, Frederic. Till
      tea-time, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were sparkling, her husky voice once more full of the appealing
      quality that could not be denied. The flush of injured pride faded from
      Mrs Desmond's brow and a faint look of surprise crept into her eyes. She
      was surprised at her own inclination to overlook the affront, and not by
      the change in Mrs Brood's manner. She smiled an unspoken pardon and stood
      aside for the new mistress to pass in front of her. To her further
      amazement the younger woman laid a hand upon her arm and gave it a gentle,
      friendly pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men watched them in silence as they left the room side by side. A
      moment later they heard the soft laughter of the two women as they mounted
      the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's splendid, father,&rdquo; he said impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood's face was still clouded. He did not respond to the eager tribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Dawes cleared his throat and cast a significant glance toward the
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to a drink to the bride, Jim?&rdquo; he said, somewhat
      explosively. He had been silent for a longer period than usual. It wasn't
      natural for him to be voiceless, even when quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; added Mr Riggs. &ldquo;I was just thinking of it myself. A health
      to the bride, my boy, and good luck to you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass to prosperity,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes, with a wave of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And two for posterity,&rdquo; added Mr Riggs in an ecstasy of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flush mounted to Brood's cheek. Young Frederic abruptly turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my friends,&rdquo; said Brood, after a moment. &ldquo;I'll leave the
      bumpers to you, if you don't mind. It isn't meet that the groom should
      drink to himself, and that's what you are suggesting. Go and have your
      drinks, gentlemen, but leave me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked disappointed, aggrieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said posterity,&rdquo; expostulated Mr Riggs. &ldquo;No harm in your drinking to <i>that</i>,
      is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Riggs,&rdquo; hissed Mr Dawes, nudging him with some violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said his friend, with a quick look at Frederic. Then, as if
      inspired: &ldquo;Come on, Freddy. Join us. Come and drink to the&mdash;to your&mdash;er&mdash;stepmother.&rdquo;
       He floundered miserably. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he gasped under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr Riggs. I'm not drinking,&rdquo; said Frederic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawes conducted Riggs to the dining-room door. There he turned and
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick to that resolution, Freddy. See what old man Riggs has come to! If
      it wasn't for me and your father he'd be in the gutter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, Freddy,&rdquo; agreed Mr Riggs with rare amiability. He felt that
      he owed something to Frederic in the way of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father and son faced each other after the old men had disappeared. They
      were a striking pair, each in his way an example of fine, clean manhood.
      The father was taller by two inches than the son, and yet Frederic was
      nearly six feet in his stockings. Both were spare men, erect and
      gracefully proportioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood gave out the impression of great strength, of steel sinews, of
      invincible power; Frederic did not suggest physical strength, and yet he
      was a clean-limbed, well-built fellow. He had a fine head, a slim body
      whose every movement proclaimed nervous energy, and a face that denoted
      temperament of the most pronounced character. His hair was black and
      straight, growing thickly above the forehead and ears; his eyes were of a
      deep gray, changeable at the dictates of his emotions. A not unhealthy
      pallor lay on the surface of his skin, readily submissive to the
      sensations which produce colour at the slightest provocation. His eyebrows
      were rather thick, but delicately arched, and the lashes were long. It was
      not a strong face, nor was it weak; it represented character without
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, James Brood's lean, handsome face was full of power.
      His gray eyes were keen, steady, compelling, and seldom alight with
      warmth. His jaw was firm, square, resolute, and the lines that sank
      heavily into the flesh in his cheeks were put there not by age but by the
      very vigour of manhood. His hair was quite gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic waited for his father to speak. He had ventured a remark before
      the departure of the old men and it had been ignored. But James Brood had
      nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very attractive, father,&rdquo; said the young man at last, almost
      wistfully. He did not realise it, but he was groping for sympathy. Brood
      had been in the house for a quarter of an hour, after an absence of nearly
      a year, and yet he might have been away no longer than a day for all that
      he revealed in his attitude toward his son. His greeting had been cold,
      casual, matter-of-fact. Frederic expected little more than that; still he
      felt in a vague way that now, if never again, the ice of reserve might be
      broken between them, if only for a moment. He was ready and willing to do
      his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood was studying the young man's face with an intensity that for the
      moment disconcerted him. He seemed bent on fixing certain features in his
      mind's eye, as if his memory had once played him false and should not do
      so again. It was a habit of Brood's, after prolonged separations, to look
      for something in the boy's face that he wanted to see and yet dreaded,
      something that might have escaped him when in daily contact with him. Now,
      at the end of the rather offensive scrutiny, he seemed to shake his head
      slightly, although one could not have been sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as charming as she is attractive, Frederic,&rdquo; he said, with a faint
      flush of the enthusiasm he suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked his son, without realising the bluntness of his
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who <i>is</i> she?&rdquo; repeated his father, raising his eyebrows slightly.
      &ldquo;She is Mrs James Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; stammered Frederic. &ldquo;I didn't mean to put it
      in that way. Who was she? Where did you meet her, and&mdash;oh, I want to
      know all there is to tell, father. I've heard nothing. I am naturally
      curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood stopped him with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was Yvonne Lestrange before we were married, Mlle Lestrange; we met
      some time ago at the house of a mutual friend in Paris. I assure you her
      references are all that could be desired.&rdquo; His tone was sarcastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry I asked the questions, sir,&rdquo; he said stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood suddenly laughed, a quiet laugh that had some trace of humour and a
      touch of compunction in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Frederic. Come up to my room and smoke a cigar with me
      while I'm changing. I'll tell you about her. She is wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his own surprise, and to Frederic's astonishment, he linked his arm in
      the young man's and started toward the hall. Afterward he was to wonder
      even more than he wondered then what it was that created the sudden desire
      to atone for the hurt look he had brought into the eyes of Matilde's son
      and the odd longing to touch his arm gently.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ydia met Brood and
      Frederic at the top of the stairs. She had received the message through
      Jones and was on her way to dress for tea. The master of the house greeted
      her most cordially. He was very fond of this lovely, gentle daughter of
      John Desmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into their association had stolen an intimate note that softened the cold
      reserve of the man to a marked degree. There was something brave and
      joyous in this girl that had always appealed to James Brood. He seldom
      failed to experience a sense of complete relaxation when with her; his
      hard eyes softened, his stern mouth took on the quiet smile of
      contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chief joy was to chat with her over the work he was doing, and to
      listen to her frank, honest opinions. There was no suggestion of
      constraint in her manner. She was not afraid of him. That was the thing
      about her, perhaps, that warmed his stone-cold heart, although he hardly
      would have admitted it to be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded herself as his secretary, or his amanuensis, in the strict
      way of speaking, but he considered her to be a friend as well, and treated
      her with a freedom that was not extended to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint gleam of astonishment lurked in the girl's eyes as she stood
      before the two men. Never, in her experience, had there been such an
      exhibition of friendliness between father and son. A curious throb of joy
      rushed up from her heart and lodged in her throat. For the first time she
      found it difficult to respond with composure to Brood's lively comments.
      Tears were lying close to the surface of her eyes; tears of relief and
      gratitude. The buoyant expression in Frederic's told a new story. Her
      heart rejoiced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Brood, when she announced that she was going in to change
      her gown. &ldquo;You never looked so pretty, my dear, as you do at this instant.
      I want Mrs Brood to see you for the first time just as you are. You are a
      shirt-waist girl, Lydia. You couldn't be lovelier than you are now. Isn't
      that true, Frederic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll spoil her, father,&rdquo; said Frederic, his face glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her prettiest frown opposed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, after all, you are not women,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Women don't look at
      each other through masculine eyes. They look at a girl not to see how
      pretty she is, but to see what it is that makes her pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is to be a family tea-party,&rdquo; protested Brood. &ldquo;It isn't a
      function, as the society reporter would say. Come just as you are to
      please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tea-party and an autopsy are very much alike, Mr Brood,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;One
      can learn a lot at either. Still, if you'd like to have Mrs Brood see me
      as I really am, I'll appear <i>sans</i> plumage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like it,&rdquo; said he promptly. &ldquo;I am sure you will like each other,
      Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you did not say we would admire each other,&rdquo; said she quaintly.
      &ldquo;You look very happy, Mr Brood,&rdquo; she went on, her eyes bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I <i>am</i> happy,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall all be happy,&rdquo; was her rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to the jade room on the upper floor, where she had been at
      work on the catalogue. Brood had a very large and valuable collection of
      rare jade. A catalogue, she knew, would have but little significance, in
      view of the fact that the collection was not likely to be exhibited to
      public view. Still it was his whim, and she had found considerable
      pleasure in carrying out his belated orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jade room, so called, was little more than a large closet off the
      remarkable room which James Brood was pleased to call his &ldquo;hiding-place,&rdquo;
       or, on occasions, his &ldquo;retreat.&rdquo; No one ventured into either of these
      rooms except by special permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranjab, his Indian servant, slept in an adjoining room, and it was
      whispered about the house that not even James Brood had viewed its
      interior. This silent, unapproachable man from the mysterious heart of
      India locked his door when he entered the room and locked it when he came
      out. No one, not even the master, thought of entering. Mr Dawes in his
      cups, or out of them, was responsible for the impression that the man kept
      deadly serpents there. As a matter of fact, Ranjab was a peaceable fellow
      and desperately afraid of snakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia loved the feel of the cold, oily lumps of jade. There were a few
      pieces of porcelain of extreme rarity and beauty as well, and several
      priceless bits of cloisonné, but it was the jade she loved. There were two
      or three hundred objects of various sizes and colours, and all were what
      might be called museum pieces. To each was attached a tag disclosing
      certain facts concerning its origin, its history, and the date of its
      admission to the Brood collection. It appeared to be Lydia's task to set
      down these dates and facts in chronological order. Her imagination built
      quaint little stories about each of the ancient figures. She believed in
      fairies.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been at work for half an hour or longer when a noise in the outer
      room attracted her attention. She had the odd feeling that someone was
      looking at her through the open door, and swiftly turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except when occupied by Brood, the room was darkened by means of heavy
      window-hangings; the effect was that produced by the gloaming just before
      the stars appeared. Objects were shadowy, indistinct, mysterious. The
      light from the jade room door threw a diverging ray across the full length
      of the room. In the very centre of this bright strip sat a placid effigy
      of Buddha that Brood had found in a remote corner of Siam, serenely stolid
      on top of its thick base of bronze and lacquer, with a shining shrine for
      a background.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dim edge of the shadow, near the door at the far end of the room,
      Lydia made out the motionless, indistinct figure of a woman. The faint
      outlines of the face were discernible, but not so the features. For a
      moment the girl stared at the watcher and then advanced to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she inquired, peering.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low, husky voice replied, with a suggestion of laughter in the tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am exploring the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia came forward at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is Mrs Brood. I beg your pardon. Shall I switch on the lights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there such awful things as electric lights in this wonderful room?&rdquo;
       cried the other, disappointed. &ldquo;I can't believe it of my husband. He
      couldn't permit anything so bizarre as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are emergency lights,&rdquo; laughed Lydia. &ldquo;He never uses them, of
      course. They are for the servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Lydia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been prowling everywhere. Your good mother deserted me when my
      maid arrived with Ranjab a short time ago. Isn't this the dread <i>Bluebeard
      room?</i> Shall I lose my head if I am discovered by the ogre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl felt the spell stealing over her. The low voice of the woman in
      the shadow was like a sensuous caress. She experienced a sudden longing to
      be closer to the speaker, to listen for the very intake of her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have already been discovered by the ogre, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; said Lydia
      gaily, &ldquo;and your head appears to be quite safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; rather curtly, as if repelling familiarity. It was like a
      dash of cold water to Lydia's spirits. &ldquo;You may turn on the lights. I
      should like to see <i>you</i>, Miss Desmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl crossed the room, passing close to the stranger in the house. The
      fragrance of a perfume hitherto unknown to her separated itself from the
      odour of sandalwood that always filled the place; it was soft, delicate,
      refreshing. It was like a breath of cool, sweet air filtering into a
      close, stuffy enclosure. One could not help drawing in a long, full
      breath, as if the lungs demanded its revivifying qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft, red glow began to fill the room as Lydia pulled the cord near the
      door. There was no clicking sound, no sharp contact of currents; the light
      came up gradually, steadily, until the whole space was drenched with its
      refulgence. There were no shadows. Every nook and corner seemed to fill
      with the warm, pleasant hue of the setting sun, and yet no visible means
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the light grew brighter and brighter the eyes of the stranger swept the
      room with undisguised wonder in their depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How extraordinary!&rdquo; she murmured, and then turned swiftly toward the
      girl. &ldquo;Where does it come from? I can see no lights. And see! There are no
      shadows, not even beneath the table yonder. It&mdash;it is uncanny&mdash;but,
      oh, how lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia was staring at her with wide-open eyes, frankly astonished. The
      eager, excited gleam vanished from Mrs Brood's lovely eyes. They narrowed
      slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you stare at me?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; cried the girl, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I couldn't help it, Mrs Brood. Why, you are young!&rdquo; The
      exclamation burst from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young?&rdquo; queried the other, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I expected&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Lydia, and stopped in pretty
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. You expected a middle-aged lady? And why, pray, should James Brood
      marry a middle-aged person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know. I'm sorry if I have offended you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood smiled, a gay, pleased little smile that revealed her small,
      even teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't offended me, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You offend my husband by
      thinking so ill of him, that's all.&rdquo; She took the girl in from head to
      foot with critical eyes. &ldquo;He said you were very pretty and very lovable.
      You are lovely. Isn't it a horrid word? Pretty! No one wants to be pretty.
      Yes, you are just what I expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia was the taller of the two women&mdash;a matter of two inches perhaps&mdash;and
      yet she had the curious feeling that she was looking upward as she gazed
      into the other's eyes. It was the way Mrs Brood held herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has known me since I was a little girl,&rdquo; she said, as if to account
      for Brood's favourable estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he knew your mother before you were born,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;She, too,
      is&mdash;shall I say pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother isn't pretty, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; said Lydia, conscious of a sudden
      feeling of resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is handsome,&rdquo; said Mrs Brood with finality. Sending a swift glance
      around the room, she went on: &ldquo;My husband delights in having beautiful
      things about him. He doesn't like the ugly things of this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia flinched, she knew not why. There was a sting to the words, despite
      the languidness with which they were uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risking more than she suspected, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never considers the cost of a thing, Mrs Brood, if its beauty appeals
      to him.&rdquo; Mrs Brood gave her a quizzical, half-puzzled look. &ldquo;You have only
      to look about you for the proof. This one room represents a fortune.&rdquo; The
      last was spoken hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you, Miss Desmond?&rdquo; The question came abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am nineteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were surprised to find me so young. Will it add to your surprise if I
      tell you that I am ten years older than you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have said not more than three or four years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am twenty-nine&mdash;seven years older than my husband's son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't seem credible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you wondering why I tell you my age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lydia bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order that you may realise that I am ten years wiser than you, and
      that you may not again make the mistake of under-estimating my
      intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colour faded from Lydia's face. She grew cold from head to foot.
      Involuntarily she moved back a pace. The next instant, to her unbounded
      surprise, Mrs Brood's hands were outstretched in a gesture of appeal, and
      a quick, wistful smile took the place of the imperious stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I am a nasty, horrid thing. Forgive me. Come! Don't be stubborn.
      Shake hands with me and say that you're sorry I said what I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a quaint way of putting it, and her voice was so genuinely
      appealing that Lydia, after a moment's hesitation, extended her hands. Mrs
      Brood grasped them in hers and gripped them tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should like to know that you are my friend, Lydia. Has it
      occurred to you that I am utterly without friends in this great city of
      yours? I have my husband, that is all. Among all these millions of people
      there is not one who knows that I exist. Isn't it appalling? Can you
      imagine such a condition? There is not one to whom I can give an honest
      smile. Nor am I likely to have many friends here. Indeed, I shall not lift
      my finger to gain them. You will know me better one day, Lydia, and you
      will understand. But now&mdash;to-day, to-morrow&mdash;now&mdash;I must
      have someone to whom I may offer my friendship and have something to hope
      for in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia could hardly credit her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you will have many friends, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; she began, vaguely
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want them,&rdquo; cried the other sharply. &ldquo;Poof! Are friends to be
      made in a day? No! Admirers, yes. Enemies, yes. But friends, no. I shall
      have no real friends here. It isn't possible. I am not like your people. I
      cannot become like them. I shall know people and like them, no doubt, but&mdash;poof!
      I shall not have them for friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand why you want me for a friend,&rdquo; said Lydia stiffly. &ldquo;My
      position here is not what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood had not released the girl's hands. She interrupted her now by
      dropping them as if they were of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want to be my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;of course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my husband's friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Mrs Brood. He is <i>my</i> friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is <i>your</i> position here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia's face was flaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you knew. I am his secretary, if I may be allowed to
      dignify my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are Frederic's friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despite your position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you, Mrs Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the warm, enchanting smile broke over the face of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it perfectly obvious, Lydia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl could no more withstand the electric charm of the woman than she
      could have fought off the sunshine. She was bewildered and completely
      fascinated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;it is very good of you,&rdquo; she murmured, her own eyes softening
      as they looked into the deep velvety ones that would not be denied. Even
      as she wondered whether she could ever really like this magnetic creature,
      she felt herself surrendering to the spell of her. &ldquo;But perhaps you will
      not like me when you know me better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mrs Brood calmly, almost indifferently, and dismissed the
      subject. &ldquo;What an amazing room! One can almost feel the presence of the
      genii that created it at the wish of the man with the enchanted lamp. As a
      rule, Oriental rooms are abominations, but this&mdash;ah, this is not an
      Oriental room after all. It is a part of the East itself&mdash;of the real
      East. I have sat in emperors' houses out there, my dear, and I have slept
      in the palaces of kings. I have seen just such things as these, and I know
      that they could not have been transported to this room except by magic. My
      husband is a magician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These came from the palaces of kings, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; said Lydia
      enthusiastically. &ldquo;Kings in the days when kings were real. This rug&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; interrupted the other. &ldquo;It was woven by five generations of
      royal weavers. Each of these borders represents the work of a lifetime. It
      is the carpet of rubies, and a war was prolonged for years because an
      emperor would not give it up to the foe who coveted it above all other
      riches. His heart's blood stains it to this day. His empire was wiped out
      by the relentless foe, his very name effaced, but the heart's blood still
      is there, Lydia. That can never be wiped out. My husband told me the
      story. It must have cost him a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worth a fortune,&rdquo; said Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      A calculating squint had come into Mrs Brood's eyes while she was
      speaking. To Lydia it appeared as if she were trying to fix upon the value
      of the wonderful carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A collector has offered him&mdash;how much? A hundred thousand dollars,
      is not that it? Ah, how rich he must be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The collector you refer to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was referring to my husband,&rdquo; said Mrs Brood, unabashed. &ldquo;He is very
      rich, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia managed to conceal her annoyance. &ldquo;I think not, as
      American fortunes are rated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter,&rdquo; said the other carelessly.
      &ldquo;I have my own fortune. And it is not my face,&rdquo; she added with her quick
      smile. &ldquo;Now let us look farther. I must see all of these wonderful things.
      We will not be missed, and it is still half an hour till tea-time. My
      husband is now telling his son all there is to be told about me&mdash;who
      and what I am, and how he came to marry me. Not, mind you, how I came to
      marry him, but&mdash;the other way round. It's the way with men past
      middle age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia hesitated before speaking.
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Brood does not confide
      in Frederic. I am afraid they have but little in common. Oh, I shouldn't
      have said that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood regarded her with narrowing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't confide in Frederic?&rdquo; she repeated in the form of a question.
      Her voice seemed lower than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry I spoke as I did, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; said the girl, annoyed with
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a reason why he should dislike his son?&rdquo; asked the other,
      regarding her fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; cried poor Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day, Lydia, you will tell me about Mr Brood's other wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She died many years ago,&rdquo; said the girl evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Mrs Brood. &ldquo;Still, I should like to hear more of the woman
      he could not forget in all those years&mdash;until he met me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grew silent and preoccupied, a slight frown marking her forehead as
      she resumed her examination of the room and its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite impossible adequately to describe the place in which the two
      women met for the first time. Suffice to say, it was long, narrow, and,
      being next below the roof, low-ceilinged. The walls were hung with rich,
      unusual tapestries whose subdued tones seemed to lure one back to the
      undimmed glory of Solomon's days, to the even more remote realms of those
      gods and goddesses on whom our fancy thrives despite the myths they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silks of a weight and lustre that taxed credulity; golden threads
      interweaving gems of the purest ray; fringe and galloons with the solemn
      waste of ages in their thin, lovely sheen; over all the soft radiance of
      an <i>Arabian Night</i> and the gentle touch of a <i>Scheherazade.</i>
      Here hung transported the fabulous splendours of Ind, the shimmering
      treasures of Ming, and the loot of the <i>Forty Thieves</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceiling, for want of a better name, was no less than a canopy
      constructed out of a single rug of enormous dimensions and incalculable
      value, gleaming with the soft colours of the rainbow, shedding a serene
      iridescence over the entire room to shame the light of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furniture, the trappings, the ornaments throughout were of a most
      unusual character. A distinctly regal atmosphere prevailed. No article
      there but had come from the palace of a ruler in the East, from the
      massive gold and lacquered table to the tiniest piece of bronze or the
      lowliest hassock. Chairs that had served as thrones, chests that had
      contained the treasures of potentates, robes that had covered the bodies
      of kings and queens, couches on which had nestled the favourites of
      sultans, screens and mirrors that had reflected the jewels of an empire&mdash;<i>all</i>
      were here to feed the senses with dreams imperial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great lanterns hung suspended beside the shrine at the end of the room,
      but were now unlighted. On the table at which Brood professed to work
      stood a huge lamp with a lacelike screen of gold. When lighted, a soft,
      mellow glow oozed through the shade to create a circle of golden
      brilliance over a radius that extended but little beyond the edge of the
      table, yet reached to the benign countenance of Buddha close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over all this fairylike splendour reigned the serene, melting influence of
      the god to whom James Brood was wont to confess himself. The spell of the
      golden image dominated everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this magnificence moved the two women&mdash;one absurdly
      out of touch with her surroundings, yet a thing of beauty; the other
      blending intimately with the warm tones that enveloped her. She was lithe,
      sinuous, with the grace of the most seductive of dancers. Her dark eyes
      reflected the mysteries of the Orient; her pale, smooth skin shone with
      the clearness of alabaster; the crimson in her lips was like the fresh
      stain of blood; the very fragrance of her person seemed to steal out of
      the unknown. She was a part of the marvellous setting, a gem among gems.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had attired herself in a dull Indian-red afternoon gown of chiffon.
      The very fabric seemed to cling to her supple body with a sensuous joy of
      contact. Even Lydia, who watched her with appraising eyes, experienced a
      swift, unaccountable desire to hold this intoxicating creature close to
      her own body.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two windows in the room, broad openings that ran from near the
      floor almost to the edge of the canopy. They were so heavily curtained
      that the light of day failed to penetrate to the interior of the
      apartment. Mrs Brood approached one of these windows. Drawing the curtains
      apart, she let in an ugly gray light from the outside world. The illusion
      was spoiled at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cold and pallid the world really is!&rdquo; she cried, a shiver passing
      over her slim body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky above the housetops was bleak and drab in the waning light of late
      afternoon. Over the summits of loft-buildings to the south and west hung
      the smoke from the river beyond, smudgy clouds that neither drifted nor
      settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down into a sort of courtyard and garden that might have been
      transplanted from distant Araby. Uttering an exclamation of wonder, she
      turned to Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this New York or am I bewitched?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Brood transformed the old carriage yard into a&mdash;I think Mr Dawes
      calls it a Persian garden. It is rather bleak in winter-time, Mrs Brood,
      but in the summer it is really enchanting. See, across the court on the
      second floor, where the windows are lighted, those are your rooms. It is
      an enormous house, you'll find. Do you see the little balcony outside your
      windows, and the vines creeping up to it? You can't imagine how sweet it
      is of a summer night with the moon and stars&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how desolate it looks to-day, with the dead vines and the colourless
      stones! Ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped the curtains. The soft, warm glow of the room came back, and
      she sighed with relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate things that are dead,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of a soft tread and the gentle rustle of draperies, they
      turned. Ranjab, the Hindu, was crossing the room toward the small door
      which gave entrance to his closet. He paused for an instant before the
      image of Buddha, but did not drop to his knees, as all devout Buddhists
      do. Mrs Brood's hand fell lightly upon Lydia's arm. The man turned toward
      them a second or two later.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dark, handsome face was hard set and emotionless as he bowed low to
      the new mistress of the house. The fingers closed tightly on Lydia's arm.
      Then he smiled upon the girl, a glad smile of devotion. His swarthy face
      was transfigured. A moment later he unlocked his door and passed into the
      other room. The key turned in the lock with a slight rasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like that man,&rdquo; said Mrs Brood. Her voice was low and her eyes
      were fixed steadily on the closed door.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he ensuing
      fortnight brought the expected changes in the household. James Brood, to
      the surprise of not only himself, but others, lapsed into a curious state
      of adolescence. His infatuation was complete. The once dominant influence
      of the man seemed to slink away from him as the passing days brought up
      the new problems of life. Where he had lived to command he now was content
      to serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends, his son, his servants viewed the transformation with wonder,
      not to say apprehension. It was not difficult to understand his
      infatuation for the&mdash;shall we say enchantress? He was not the only
      one there to fall under the spell. But it was almost unbelievable that he
      should submit to thraldom with the complacency of a weakling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love, which had been lying bruised and unconscious within him for twenty
      years and more, arose from its stupor and became a thing to play with, as
      one would play with a child. The old, ugly vistas melted into dreamy,
      adolescent contemplations of a paradise in which he could walk
      hand-in-hand with the future and find that the ghosts of the past no
      longer attended him along the once weary way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not be true to say that the remarkable personality of the man had
      suffered. He was still the man of steel, but re-tempered. The rigid
      broadsword was made over into the fine, flexible blade of Toledo. He could
      be bent but not broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pleased him to submit to Yvonne's commands,
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that they were arduous or peremptory; on the contrary, they were
      suggestions in which his own comfort and pleasure appeared to be the
      inspiration. He found something like delight in being rather amiably
      convinced of his own shortcomings; in learning from her that his life up
      to this hour had been a sadly mismanaged affair; that there were soft,
      fertile spots in his heart where things would grow in spite of him. He
      enjoyed the unique spectacle of himself in the process of being made over
      to fit ideals that he would have scorned a few months before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was too wise to demand, too clever to resort to cajolery. She was a
      Latin. Diplomacy was hers as a birthright. Complaints, appeals, sulks
      would have gained nothing from James Brood. It would not have occurred to
      her to employ these methods. From the day she entered the house she was
      its mistress. She was sure of her ground, sure of herself, fettered by no
      sense of doubt as to her position there, bound by no feminine notion of
      gratitude to man, as many women are who find themselves married. It might
      almost be said of her that she ruled without making a business of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, she miraculously transferred the sleeping quarters of
      Messrs Dawes and Riggs from the second floor front to the third floor back
      without arousing the slightest sign of antagonism on the part of the
      crusty old gentlemen who had occupied one of the choice rooms in the house
      with uninterrupted security for a matter of nine or ten years. This was a
      feat that James Brood himself would never have tried to accomplish. They
      had selected this room at the first instant of occupation, because it
      provided something of a view up and down the street from the big bow
      window, and they wouldn't evacuate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood explained the situation to them so graciously, so convincingly,
      that they even assisted the servants in moving their heterogeneous
      belongings to the small, remote room on the third floor, and applauded her
      plan to make a large sitting-room of the chamber they were deserting. It
      did not occur to them for at least three days that they had been imposed
      upon, cheated, maltreated, insulted, and then it was too late. The
      decorators were in the big room on the second floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps they would not have arrived at a sense of realisation even then if
      it had not come out in the course of conversation that it was not to be a
      <i>general</i> sitting-room, but one with reservations. The discovery of
      what they secretly were pleased to call duplicity brought an abrupt end to
      the period of abstemiousness that had lasted since the day of her arrival,
      when, out of courtesy to the bride, they had turned their backs upon the
      tipple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, the situation was desperate. She had tricked them with her
      wily politeness. They had been betrayed by the wife of their bosom friend.
      Is it small cause for wonder, then, that the poor gentlemen as manfully
      turned back to the tipple and got gloriously, garrulously drunk in the
      middle of the afternoon and also in the middle of the library, where tea
      was to have been served to a few friends asked in to meet the bride?
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning a fresh edict was issued. It came from James Brood, and
      it was so staggering that the poor gentlemen were loath to believe their
      ears. As a result of this new command they began to speak of Mrs Brood in
      the privacy of their own room as &ldquo;that woman.&rdquo; Of course, it was entirely
      due to her mischievous, malevolent influence that a spineless husband put
      forth the order that they were to have nothing more to drink while they
      remained in his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      This command was modified to a slight extent later on. Brood felt sorry
      for the victims. He loved them, and he knew that their pride was injured a
      great deal more than their appetite. In its modified form the edict
      allowed them a small drink in the morning and another at bedtime, but the
      doses (as they sarcastically called them) were to be administered by Jones
      the butler, who held the key to the situation and&mdash;the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a dispensary?&rdquo; wailed Mr Dawes in weak horror. &ldquo;Are we to stand
      in line and solicit the common necessities of life? Answer me, Riggs!
      Confound you, don't stand there like a wax figure! Say something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Riggs shook his head bleakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jim,&rdquo; was all that he said, and rolled his eyes heavenward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Dawes reflected. After many minutes the tears started down his rubicund
      cheeks. &ldquo;Poor old Jim,&rdquo; he sighed. And after that they looked upon Mrs
      Brood as the common enemy of all three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of Mrs John Desmond was disposed of in a summary but tactful
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mrs Desmond is willing to remain, James, as housekeeper instead of
      friend, all well and good,&rdquo; said Mrs Brood, discussing the matter in the
      seclusion of her boudoir. &ldquo;I doubt, however, whether she can descend to
      that. You have spoiled her, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood was manifestly pained and uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was the wife of my best friend, Yvonne. I have never permitted her to
      feel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;the wives of best friends! Nearly every man has
      the wife of a best friend somewhere in his life's history.&rdquo; She shook her
      head at him with mock mournfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flushed. &ldquo;I trust you do not mean to imply that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you would say. No, I do not mean anything of the sort. Still,
      you now have a wife of your own. Is it advisable to have also the wife of
      a best friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Yvonne, all this sounds very suspicious and&mdash;unpleasant. Mrs
      Desmond is the soul of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear man, why should you defend her? I am not accusing her. I am
      merely going into the ethics of the situation. If you can forget that Mrs
      Desmond is the wife of your friend and come to regard her as a servant in
      your establishment, no one will be more happy than I to have her about the
      place. She is fine, she is competent, she is a lady. But she is not my
      equal here. Can't you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was thoughtful for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you are right. The conditions are peculiar. I can't go to her
      and say that she must consider herself as&mdash;oh, no, that would be
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have Mrs Desmond as my friend, not as my housekeeper,&rdquo;
       said his wife simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, and that's just what I should like,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but one way, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be one or the other, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; she said with firmness. &ldquo;In my country, James, the wives of
      best friends haven't the same moral standing that they appear to have in
      yours. Oh, don't scowl so! Shall I tell you again that I do not mean to
      reflect on Mrs Desmond's virtue&mdash;or discretion? Far from it. If she
      is to be my friend, she cannot be your housekeeper. That's the point. Has
      she any means of her own? Can she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a small income, and an annuity which I took out for her soon
      after her poor husband's death. We were the closest of friends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, James. You are very generous and very loyal. I quite
      understand. Losing her position here, then, will not be a hardship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite competent, James,&rdquo; she said brightly. &ldquo;You will not miss her,
      I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that, Yvonne,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Mrs Desmond and Lydia have been
      factors in my life for so long that&mdash;&mdash; But, of course, that is
      neither here nor there. I will explain the situation to her to-morrow. She
      will understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, James. You are really quite reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you laughing at me, darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him one of her searching, unfathomable glances, and she smiled
      with roguish mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it your mission in life to amuse and entertain me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, Yvonne. Good God, how I love you!&rdquo; he cried abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes burned with a sudden flame of passion as he bent over her. His
      face quivered; his whole being tingled with the fierce spasm of an
      uncontrollable desire to crush the warm, adorable body to his breast in
      the supreme ecstasy of possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      She surrendered herself to his passionate embrace. A little later she
      withdrew herself from his arms, her lips still quivering with the
      fierceness of his kisses. Her eyes, dark with wonder and perplexity,
      regarded his transfigured face for a long, tense moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this love, James?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Is this the real, true love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else, in Heaven's name, can it be?&rdquo; he cried. He was sitting upon
      the arm of her chair, looking down at the strangely pallid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But should love have the power to frighten me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frighten, my darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is not you who are frightened,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You are the man. But I&mdash;ah,
      I am only the woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared. &ldquo;What an odd way to put it, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he drew back, struck by the curious gleam of mockery in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it like this twenty-five years ago?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you love her&mdash;like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He managed to smile. &ldquo;Are you jealous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face hardened. &ldquo;Some other time, not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you loved her, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be silly, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she loved you. If you loved her as you love me, she could not have
      helped&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, please, Yvonne!&rdquo; he exclaimed, a dull red setting in his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never told me her name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He faced her, his eyes as cold as steel. &ldquo;I may as well tell you now,
      Yvonne, that her name is never mentioned in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to shrink down farther in the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, an insistent note in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't necessary to explain.&rdquo; He walked away from her to the window and
      stood looking out over the bleak little courtyard. Neither spoke for many
      minutes, and yet he knew that her questioning gaze was upon him and that
      when he turned to her again she would ask still another question. He tried
      to think of something to say that would turn her away from this hated
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it time for you to dress, dearest? The Gunnings live pretty far up
      north and the going will be bad with Fifth Avenue piled up with snow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't Frederic ever mention his mother's name?&rdquo; came the question that
      he feared before it was uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not certain that he knows her name,&rdquo; said he levelly. The knuckles
      of his hands, clenched tightly behind his back, were white. &ldquo;He has never
      heard me utter it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him darkly. There was something in her eyes that caused him
      to shift his own steady gaze uncomfortably. He could not have explained
      what it was, but it gave him a curiously uneasy feeling, as of impending
      peril. It was not unlike the queer, inexplicable, though definite, sensing
      of danger that more than once he had experienced in the silent, tranquil
      depths of great forests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you loved her just the same, James, up to the time you met me. Is not
      that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed loudly. &ldquo;It is not true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what could have happened to make you so bitter toward her,&rdquo; she
      went on, still watching him through half-closed eyes. &ldquo;Was she unfaithful
      to you? Was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, Yvonne!&rdquo; he cried, an angry light jumping into his eyes&mdash;the
      eyes that so recently had been ablaze with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be angry, dearest,&rdquo; she cried plaintively. &ldquo;We Europeans speak of
      such things as if they were mere incidents. I forget that you Americans
      take them seriously, as tragedies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He controlled himself with an effort. The pallor in his face would have
      alarmed anyone but her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must never speak of&mdash;of that again, Yvonne,&rdquo; he said, a queer
      note of hoarseness in his voice. &ldquo;Never, do you understand?&rdquo; He was very
      much shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she pleaded, stretching out her hand to him. &ldquo;I am foolish,
      but I did not dream that I was being cruel or unkind. Perhaps, dear, it is
      because I am&mdash;jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one&mdash;nothing to be jealous of,&rdquo; he said, passing a hand
      over his moist brow. Then he drew nearer and took her hand in his. It was
      as cold as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hand is cold, darling,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yours, too,&rdquo; she said, looking down at their clasped hands, a faint
      smile on her lips. Suddenly she withdrew her fingers from his strong grip.
      A slight shiver ran over her frame. &ldquo;Ugh! I don't like cold hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed rather desolately. &ldquo;Suppose that I were to say the same to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am temperamental; you are not,&rdquo; she replied coolly. &ldquo;Sit down, dear.
      Let us be warm again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I have the fire replenished&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with her slow smile, &ldquo;you don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lounged again on the arm of her chair. She leaned back and sighed
      contentedly, the smile on her red lips growing sweeter with each breath
      that she took. He felt his blood warming once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time they sat thus, looking into each other's eyes without
      speaking. He was trying to fathom the mystery that lurked at the bottom of
      those smiling wells; she, on the other hand, deluded herself with the idea
      that she was reading his innermost thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been considering the advisability of sending Frederic abroad for a
      year or two,&rdquo; said he at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. She had been far from right in her reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now? This winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He has never been abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? And he is half European, too. It seems&mdash;forgive me, James.
      Really, you know, I cannot always keep my thoughts from slipping out. You
      shouldn't expect it, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know that his&mdash;his mother was a European?&rdquo; he inquired
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! What manner of woman do you think I am? Without curiosity? I
      should be a freak. I have inquired of Mrs Desmond. There was no harm in
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she tell you? But no! It doesn't matter. We shan't discuss it.
      We&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me little or nothing,&rdquo; she broke in quickly. &ldquo;You may rest quite
      easy, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Yvonne, I don't understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us speak of Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is only natural that you should inquire,&rdquo; he said
      resignedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my servants,&rdquo; she added pointedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flushed slightly. &ldquo;I dare say I deserve the rebuke. It will not be
      necessary to pursue that line of inquiry, however. I shall tell you the
      story myself some day, Yvonne. Will you not bear with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She met the earnest appeal in his eyes with a slight frown of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is to tell me the wife's side of the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was like a blow to him. He stared at her as if he had not
      heard aright. Before he could speak she went on coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say there are two sides to it, James. It's usually the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He winced. &ldquo;There is but one side to this one,&rdquo; he said, a harsh note in
      his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I began my inquiries with Mrs Desmond,&rdquo; she said
      enigmatically. &ldquo;But I shan't pursue them any farther. You love <i>me</i>;
      that is all I care to know&mdash;or that I require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>do</i> love you,&rdquo; he said, almost imploringly. She stroked his gaunt
      cheek. &ldquo;Then we may let the other woman&mdash;go hang, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt the cold sweat start on his brow. Her callous remark slashed his
      finer sensibilities like the thrust of a dagger. He tried to laugh, but
      only succeeded in producing a painful grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she went on, as if the matter were fully disposed of, &ldquo;we will
      discuss something tangible, eh? Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, rather dazedly. &ldquo;Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very, very fond of your son, James,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How proud you must
      be to have such a son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He eyed her narrowly. How much of the horrid story did she know? How much
      of it had John Desmond told to his wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised at your liking him, Yvonne. He is what I'd call a
      difficult young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't found him difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morbid and unresponsive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by nature, however. There is a joyousness, a light-heartedness in his
      character that has never got beyond the surface until now, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And you talk of sending him away. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has wanted to go abroad for years. This is a convenient time for him
      to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am quite sure he will not care to go at present&mdash;not for a
      while, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his jaw setting hard.
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in love with Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put a stop to that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, may I ask?&rdquo; she mimicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he burst out, but instantly collected
      himself. &ldquo;He is not in a position to marry, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Financially?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swallowed hard. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poof!&rdquo; she exclaimed, dismissing the obstacle with a wave of her slim
      hand. &ldquo;A cigarette, please. There is another reason why he shouldn't go&mdash;an
      excellent one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason you've already given is sufficient to convince me that he
      ought to go at once. What is the other one, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lighted a cigarette from the match he held. &ldquo;What would you say if I
      were to tell you that I object to his going away&mdash;at present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should ask the very obvious question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I like him, I want him to like me, and I shall be very lonely
      without him,&rdquo; she answered calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are frank, to say the least,&rdquo; said he, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And serious. I don't want him to go away at present. Later on, yes; but
      not now. I shall need him, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be lonely, you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. You forget that I am young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he, a sudden pain in his heart. &ldquo;Perhaps it would be more to
      the point if you were to say that I forget that I am old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. It was a soft, musical laugh that strangely stilled the
      tumult in his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are younger than Frederic,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Unless we do something to
      prevent it, your son will be an old man before he is thirty. Don't send
      him away now, James. Let me have him for a while. I mean it, dear. He is a
      lonely boy, and I know what it is to be lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, you've never known anything but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can be lonely even in the heart of a throng,&rdquo; she said cryptically.
      &ldquo;No, James, I will not have him sent away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He resented the imputation. &ldquo;Why do you say that I am sending him away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are,&rdquo; she replied boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment. &ldquo;We will leave it to Frederic,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face brightened. &ldquo;That is all I ask. He will stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause. &ldquo;You two have become very good friends, Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is devoted to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't spoil him in making him over,&rdquo; he said dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blew cigarette&mdash;smoke in his face and laughed. There was a knock
      at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic entered.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> certain element
      of gaiety invaded the staid old house in these days. The new mistress was
      full of life and the joy of living. She was accustomed to adulation, she
      was used to the tumult of society. Her life, since she left the convent
      school, evidently had been one in which rest, except physical, was
      unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne Lestrange, in a way, had been born to purple and fine linen. She
      had never known deprivation of any description. Neither money, position,
      nor love had been denied her during the few years in which her charm and
      beauty had flashed across the great European capitals, penetrating even to
      the recesses of royal courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful if James Brood knew very much concerning her family when he
      proposed marriage to her, but it is certain that he did not care. He first
      saw her at the home of a British nobleman, but did not meet her. Something
      in the vivid, brilliant face of the woman made a deep and lasting
      impression on him. There was an instant when their eyes met through an
      opening in the throng which separated them. He was not only conscious of
      the fact that he was staring at her, but that she was looking at him in a
      curiously penetrating way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a mocking smile on her lips at the time. He saw it fade away,
      even as the crowd came between. He knew that the smile had not been
      intended for him, but for someone of the eager cavaliers who surrounded
      her, and yet there was something singularly direct in the look she gave
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on he made inquiries of his host, with whom he had hunted big game
      in Africa, and learned that she was a guest in the home of the Russian
      ambassador. He did not see her again until they met in the south of France
      a few months later. On this occasion they were guests at the same house,
      and he took her into dinner. He had not forgotten her, and it gratified
      him immensely to discover that she remembered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That single glance in the duke's house proved to be a fatal one for both.
      They were married inside of a month. The virile, confident American had
      conquered where countless suppliants of a more or less noble character had
      gone down to defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked but one question of her; she asked none of him. The fact that she
      was the intimate friend and associate of the woman in whose home he met
      her was sufficient proof of her standing in society, although that would
      have counted for little so far as Brood was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the daughter of a baron; she had spent much of her life in Paris,
      coming from St Petersburg when a young girl; and she was an orphan with an
      independent fortune of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her home in Paris, where she had lived with some degree of permanence for
      the past four or five years, was shared with an estimable, though
      impoverished, lady of rank, the Countess de Rochambert, of middle age and
      undeniable qualifications as a chaperon, even among those who are prone to
      laugh at locksmiths. Such common details as these came to Brood in the
      natural way and were not derived from any effort on his part to secure
      information concerning Mlle Lestrange. Like the burned child, he asked a
      question which harked back to an unforgotten pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever loved a man deeply, devotedly, Yvonne&mdash;so deeply that
      there is pain in the thought of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replied without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no such man, James. You may be sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am confident that I can hold your love against the future, but no man
      is vital enough to compete with the past. Love doesn't really die, you
      know. If a man cannot hold a woman's love against all new-comers, he
      deserves to lose it. It doesn't follow, however, that he can protect
      himself against the man who appears out of the past and claims his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as though the past had played you an evil trick,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not mince words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years ago a man came out of the past and took from me the woman I loved
      and cherished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your&mdash;your wife?&rdquo; she asked in a voice suddenly lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder at your courage in taking the risk again,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I wonder at it myself,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No, I am not afraid,&rdquo; he went
      on, as if convincing himself that there was no risk. &ldquo;I shall make you
      love me to the end, Yvonne. I am not afraid. But why do you not ask me for
      all the wretched story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not unlike all stories of its kind, my dear,&rdquo; she said with an
      indifference that amazed him. &ldquo;They are all alike. Why should I ask? The
      wife takes up with an old lover; she deceives her husband; the world
      either does or does not find out about it; the home is wrecked; the
      husband takes to drink; the wife pretends she is happy; the lover takes to
      women; and the world goes on just the same in spite of them. Sometimes the
      husband kills. It is of no moment. Sometimes the wife destroys herself. It
      is a trifle. The whole business is like the magazine story that is for
      ever being continued in our next. No, I do not ask you for your story,
      James. Some time you may tell me, but not to-day. I shouldn't mind hearing
      it if it were an original tale, but God knows it isn't. It's as old as the
      Nile. But you may tell me more about your son. Is he like you, or like his
      mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood's lips were compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say that he is like either of us,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That makes quite a difference. Perhaps, after all, I
      shall be interested in the story.&rdquo; Her manner was so casual, so serenely,
      matter-of-fact, that he could hardly restrain the sharp exclamation of
      annoyance that rose to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bit his lip and allowed the frank insinuation to go unanswered. He
      consoled himself with the thought that she must have spoken in jest
      without intention. He had the uncomfortable feeling that she would make
      light of his story, too, when the time came for revelations. A curious
      doubt took root in his mind: Would he ever be able to understand the
      nature of this woman whom he loved and who appeared to love him so
      unreservedly? As time went on the doubt became a conviction. She proved to
      be utterly beyond Brood's comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charm and beauty of the new mistress of James Brood's heart and home
      was to become the talk of the town. Already, in the first month of her
      reign, she had drawn to the old house the attention not only of the
      parasites who feed on novelty, but of families that had long since given
      up Brood as a representative figure in the circle into which he had been
      born.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had dropped out of their lives so completely in the passing years that
      no one took the trouble to interest himself in the man's affairs. His
      self-effacement had been complete. The story of his ill-fated marriage was
      an almost forgotten page in the history of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old friends now cudgelled their brains to recall the details of the break
      between him and the first Mrs Brood, who, they were bound to remember, was
      also beautiful, fascinating, and an adornment to the rather exclusive
      circle in which they moved. No one could point to the real cause of the
      separation, however, for the excellent reason that the true conditions
      were never revealed to anyone outside the four walls of the house from
      which she was banished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memory merely brought to mind the fact that the young husband became a
      wanderer on the face of the earth, and that his once joyous face was an
      almost forgotten object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood, in the full pride of possession, awoke to the astounding
      realisation that he wanted people to envy him this wonderful creature. He
      wanted men to covet her! He longed to have the world see her at his side,
      and to feel that the world was saying: &ldquo;She belongs to James Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not the cheap, ordinary New York society, the insufferably rich and
      vulgar of the metropolis that he sought to conquer, but the fine old
      families with whom rests the real verdict. He knew that those families
      were not many in these days of haste and waste, but he also knew that the
      rush of frivolity had not weakened their position. Their word was still
      the law. Serenely confident, he revealed his wife to the few, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be said that she conquered, for that would be to imply design on
      her part. Possibly she considered the game unworthy of the effort. For, in
      truth, Yvonne Brood despised Americans. She made small pretence of liking
      them. The rather closely knit circle of Parisian aristocracy which she
      affected is known to tolerate, but not to invite, the society of even the
      best of Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was no larger than her environment. Her views upon and her attitude
      toward the Americans were not created by her but for her. The fact that
      James Brood had reached the inner shrine of French self-worship no doubt
      put him in a class apart from all other Americans, so far as she was
      concerned. At least it may account for an apparent inconsistency, in that
      she married him without much hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She welcomed the admiration and attention of the friends he brought to the
      house by one means or another during the first few weeks. If she was
      surprised to find them cultured, clever, agreeable specimens, she failed
      to mention the discovery to him. They amused her and therefore served a
      purpose. She charmed them in exchange for the tribute they paid to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those whom she liked the least she took no pains to please; in fact, she
      endured them so politely that while they may have secretly resented her
      indifference, they could do no less than openly profess admiration for
      her. She offended no one, yet she managed with amazing adroitness to rid
      herself of the bores. It happened, however, that the so-called bores were
      the very people that Brood particularly wanted her to cultivate. She found
      them stupid, but respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were for ever telling her that she would like New York when she got
      used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her warmest friend and admirer&mdash;one might almost say slave&mdash;was
      Frederic Brood. She had transformed him. He was no longer the silent,
      moody youth of other days, but an eager, impetuous playmate, whose
      principal object in life was to amuse her. If anyone had tried to convince
      him that he could have regarded Mrs Desmond's dethronement and departure
      with equanimity he would have protested with all the force at his command.
      But that would have been a month ago!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came for his old friend to leave the house over which she
      had presided for ten of the gentlest years of his life, his heart was sore
      and his throat was tight with pain, but he accepted the inevitable with a
      resignation that once would have been impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the outset he realised that Mrs Desmond would have to go. At first he
      rebelled within himself against the unspoken edict. Afterward he was
      surprised to find that he regarded himself as selfish in even wishing that
      she might stay, when it was so palpably evident that the situation could
      not long remain pleasant for either Mrs Desmond or Mrs Brood. He saw Lydia
      and her mother leave without the slightest doubt in his mind that it was
      all for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Desmonds took a small apartment just around the corner from Brood's
      home, in a side street, and in the same block. Their windows looked down
      into the courtyard in the rear of Brood's home. Frederic assisted them in
      putting their new home in order. It was great fun for Lydia and him, this
      building of what they were pleased to call &ldquo;a nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia may have seen the cloud in their sky, but he did not. To him the
      world was bright and gladsome, without a shadow to mar its new beauty. He
      was enthusiastic, eager, excited. She fell in with his spirit, but her
      pleasure was shorn of some of its keenness by the odd notion that it was
      not to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He even dragged Yvonne around to the little flat to expatiate upon its
      cosiness with visual proof to support his somewhat exaggerated claims. Her
      lazy eyes took in the apartment at a glance and she was done with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very charming,&rdquo; she said with her soft drawl. &ldquo;Have you no
      cigarettes, Lydia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl flushed and looked to Frederic for relief. He promptly produced
      his own cigarettes. Yvonne lighted one and then stretched herself in the
      Morris chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should learn to smoke,&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother wouldn't like me to smoke,&rdquo; said Lydia rather bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint frown appeared on Frederic's brow, only to disappear with Yvonne's
      low, infectious laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Freddy doesn't like you to smoke either, <i>aïe?</i>&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have changed his mind recently, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; said the girl, smiling
      so frankly that the edge was taken off of a rather direct implication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind women smoking,&rdquo; put in Frederic hastily. &ldquo;In fact, I rather
      like it, the way Yvonne does it. It's a very graceful accomplishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am too clumsy to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; interrupted the Parisienne, carelessly flicking the ash into a
      <i>jardinière</i> at her elbow, &ldquo;it is very naughty to smoke, and clumsy
      women never should be naughty. If you really feel clumsy, don't, for my
      sake, ever try to do anything wicked. There is nothing so distressing as
      an awkward woman trying to be devilish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lydia couldn't be devilish if she tried!&rdquo; cried Frederic, with a
      quick glance at the girl's half-averted face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say that, Frederic,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That's as much as to say that I <i>am</i>
      clumsy and awkward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are not,&rdquo; said Yvonne decisively. &ldquo;You are very pretty and
      graceful and adorable, and I am sure you could be very wicked if you set
      about to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Lydia dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, this window looks almost directly down into our courtyard,&rdquo;
       said Yvonne abruptly. She was leaning on her elbow, looking out upon the
      housetops below. &ldquo;There is my balcony, Freddy. And one can almost look
      into your father's lair from where I sit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew back from the window suddenly, a passing look of fear in her
      eyes. It was gone in a second, and would have passed unnoticed but for the
      fact that Frederic was, as usual, watching her face with rapt interest. He
      caught the curious transition and involuntarily glanced below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy curtains in the window of his father's retreat were drawn apart,
      and the dark face of Ranjab, the Hindu, was plainly distinguishable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking up at the window in which Mrs Brood was sitting. Although
      Frederic was far above, he could see the gleaming white of the man's eyes.
      The curtains fell quickly together and the gaunt, brown face was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd feeling of uneasiness came over the young man. It was the feeling
      of one who suddenly realises that he is being spied upon. He could not
      account for the faint chill that ran through his body, leaving him
      strangely cold and drear.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the meaning of that intense scrutiny from his father's window?
      Was Ranjab alone in the room? How did he happen to expose himself at the
      very instant Yvonne appeared in the window above? These and other
      questions raced through Frederic's puzzled brain. Out of them grew a
      queer, almost uncanny feeling that the Hindu had called to her in the
      still, mysterious voice of the East, and, although no sound had been
      uttered, she had heard as plainly as if he actually had shouted to her
      across the intervening space.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled the tales of the old men, in which they spoke of the
      unaccountable swiftness with which news leaped across the unpopulated
      deserts, far in advance of any material means of transmission. Along the
      reaches of the Nile and in the jungles of India, weird instances of the
      astonishing projection of thought across vast spaces were constantly being
      reported. There was magic in the air. News travelled faster than the
      swiftest steed, even faster than the engines of man, into the most remote
      places, and yet there was no visible, tangible force behind the remarkable
      achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father had said more than once that the Hindu and the Egyptian
      possessed the power to be in two distinct places at the same time. He was
      wont to establish his theory by reciting the single instance of a sick
      dragoman who had been left behind in a village on the edge of the desert,
      with no means of crossing the vast stretch. And yet, when the caravan
      reached its destination after a long but record-breaking march, the man
      himself met them on the outskirts of the town with the astonishing report
      that he was quite well and strong after a two weeks' rest in his own house
      just inside of the city gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he had passed them on the desert, and how he had reached his home a
      fortnight ahead of them, was one of the greatest mysteries James Brood had
      ever sought to unravel. The man's presence there created no surprise among
      the native members of the caravan. To them it was a most ordinary thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in the depths of an Indian jungle Brood expressed the wish that he
      had brought with him a certain rifle he had left at home. Not a man left
      the camp, and yet at the end of the week a strange Hindu appeared with the
      rifle, having traversed several hundred miles of practically unexplored
      country in the time that would have been required to get the message to
      Lahore by horse alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Brood, a sensible man, was a firm believer in magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much Frederic knew of Ranjab: if James Brood needed him, no matter
      what the hour or the conditions, the man appeared before him as if out of
      nowhere and in response to no audible summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there, then, between these two, the beautiful Yvonne and the silent
      Hindu, a voiceless pact that defied the will or understanding of either?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not failed to note a tendency on her part to avoid the Hindu as
      much as possible. She even confessed to an uncanny dread of the man, but
      could not explain the feeling. Once she requested her husband to dismiss
      the faithful fellow. When he demanded the reason, however, she could only
      reply that she did not like the man and would feel happier if he were sent
      away. Brood refused, and from that hour her fear of the Hindu increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she was speaking in a nervous hurried manner to Lydia, her back toward
      the window. In the middle of a sentence she suddenly got up from the chair
      and moved swiftly to the opposite side of the room, where she sat down
      again as far as possible from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic found himself watching her face with curious interest. All the
      time she was speaking her eyes were fixed on the window. It was as if she
      expected something to appear there. There was no mistaking the expression.
      After studying her face in silence for a few minutes, Frederic himself
      experienced an irresistible impulse to turn toward the window. He half
      expected to see the Hindu's face there, looking in upon them, a perfectly
      absurd notion when he remembered that they were at least one hundred feet
      above the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she arose to go. No, she could not wait for Mrs Desmond's
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is charming here, Lydia,&rdquo; she said, surveying the little sitting-room
      with eyes that sought the window again and again in furtive darts.
      &ldquo;Frederic must bring me here often. We shall have cosy times here, we
      three. It is so convenient, too, for you, my dear. You have only to walk
      around the corner, and there you are&mdash;at your place of business, as
      the men would say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia was to continue as Brood's amanuensis. He would not listen to any
      other arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do hope you will come, Mrs Brood!&rdquo; cried the girl earnestly. &ldquo;My
      piano will be here to-morrow, and you shall hear Frederic play. He is
      really wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm the rankest duffer going, Yvonne,&rdquo; broke in Frederic, but his eyes
      were alight with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You play?&rdquo; asked Mrs Brood, regarding him rather fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He disappears for hours at a time,&rdquo; said Lydia, speaking for him, &ldquo;and
      comes home humming fragments from&mdash;oh, but I am not supposed to tell!
      Forgive me, Frederic. Dear me! What have I done?&rdquo; She was plainly
      distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm in telling Yvonne,&rdquo; said he, but uneasily. &ldquo;You see, it's this
      way: father doesn't like the idea of my going in for music. He is really
      very much opposed to it. So I've been sort of stealing a march on him&mdash;going
      up to a chum's apartment and banging away to my heart's content. It's
      rather fun, too, doing it on the sly. Of course, if father heard of it
      he'd&mdash;he'd&mdash;well, he'd be nasty about it, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nasty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got rid of our own piano a long time ago, just because he doesn't like
      music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he does like music,&rdquo; said Yvonne, her voice a little huskier than
      usual. &ldquo;In Paris we attended the opera, the concerts. I am sure he likes
      music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy it must have been my fault, then,&rdquo; said Frederic wryly. &ldquo;I was
      pretty bad at it in those days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not let you have a piano in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave them a queer little smile. &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; she said, and that was
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, it would be great if you could get him to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure he would like Frederic's music now, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; Lydia broke in
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you play&mdash;what do you like best, Frederic?&rdquo; inquired Yvonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those wonderful little Hungarian things most of all; the plaintive
      little melodies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped as she began to hum lightly the strains of one of Ziehrer's
      jaunty waltzes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, how did you guess? Why, it's my favourite. I love it, Yvonne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall play it for me&mdash;to-morrow, Lydia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The piano will be here in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you guess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind! I am a witch, <i>aïe?</i> Come! I must be off now, Frederic.
      There are people coming to have tea with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they descended in the elevator Frederic, unable to contain himself,
      burst out rapturously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Yvonne, it will be fun, coming over here every day or so for a
      little music, won't it? I can't tell you how happy I shall be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time you were happy,&rdquo; said she, looking straight ahead, and many
      days passed before he had an inkling of all that lay behind her remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the house Jones met them in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Brood telephoned that he would be late, madam. He is at the customs
      office about the boxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused at the foot of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has he been out, Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since two o'clock, madam. It is now half-past four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be five or six in for tea, Jones. You may serve it in Mr
      Brood's study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of surprise flitted across the butler's impassive face. For a
      moment he had doubted his hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ask Ranjab to put away Mr Brood's writing materials and
      reference-books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall attend to it myself, madam. Ranjab went out with Mr Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went out!&rdquo; exclaimed Yvonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic turned upon the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be mistaken, Jones,&rdquo; he said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, sir. They went away together in the automobile. He has not
      returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long look of wonder and perplexity passed between young Brood and his
      stepmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed suddenly and unnaturally. Without a word she started up the
      stairs. He followed more slowly, his puzzled eyes fixed on the graceful
      figure ahead. At the upper landing she stopped. Her hand grasped the
      railing with rigid intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranjab emerged from the shadows at the end of the hall. He bowed very
      deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The master's books and papers 'ave been removed, madam. The study is in
      order.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he two old men,
      long since relegated to a somewhat self-imposed oblivion, on a certain
      night discussed, as usual, the affairs of the household in the privacy of
      their room on the third floor. Not, however, without first convincing
      themselves that the shadowy Ranjab was nowhere within range of their
      croaking undertones. From the proscribed regions downstairs came the faint
      sounds of a piano and the intermittent chatter of many voices. Someone was
      playing &ldquo;La Paloma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These new days were not like the old ones. Once they had enjoyed, even
      commanded, the full freedom of the house. It had been their privilege,
      their prerogative, to enter into every social undertaking that was
      planned. They had come to regard themselves as hosts, or, at the very
      least, guests of honour on such occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that the occasions were many where guests came to be entertained by
      James Brood of old, but it seemed to be an accepted and quite agreeable
      duty of theirs to convince the infrequent visitors that Brood's house was
      really quite a jolly place, and that it would pay them to drop in oftener.
      They had a joyous way of lifting the responsibility of conversation from
      everyone else; and, be it said to their credit, there was no subject on
      which they couldn't talk with decision and fluency, whether they knew
      anything about it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      And nowadays it was different. They were not permitted to appear when
      guests were in the house. The sumptuous dinners, of which they heard
      something from the servants, were no longer graced by their presence. They
      were amazed, and not a little irritated, to learn, by listening at the
      head of the stairs, that the unfortunate guests, whoever they were, always
      seemed to be enjoying themselves. They couldn't understand how such a
      condition was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dined, to dignify the function somewhat, at least an hour before the
      guests arrived, and then shuffled off to their little back room, where
      they affected cribbage but indulged in something a great deal more
      acrimonious. They said many harsh things about the new mistress of the
      house. They could not understand what had come over James Brood. There was
      a time, said they, when no one could have led him around by the nose, and
      now he was as spineless as an angleworm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On nights when guests were expected they were not permitted to have a drop
      of anything to drink, Mrs Brood declaring that she could not afford to run
      the risk of having them appear in the drawing-room despite the edict. They
      also had a habit of singing rather boisterously when intoxicated,
      something about a girl in Bombay; or, when especially happy, about a
      couple of ladies in Hottentot land who didn't mind the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a matter of discretion, therefore, to lock up the spirits, and,
      after a fashion, to lock up the old gentlemen as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a concession they were at liberty to invade the &ldquo;retreat,&rdquo; and to make
      themselves at home among the relics. Guests were seldom, if ever, taken up
      to Brood's room. Only the most intimate of friends were admitted. Even the
      jade room, with all of its priceless treasures, was closed to &ldquo;outsiders,&rdquo;
       for Brood had the idea that people as a rule did not possess a great
      amount of intelligence. So it was usually quite safe to allow Mr Dawes and
      Mr Riggs to run loose in the study, with the understanding, of course,
      that they were not to venture beyond the top of the stairs, and were not
      to smoke pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood had been working rather steadily at his journal during the past two
      or three weeks. He had reached a point in the history where his own memory
      was somewhat vague, and had been obliged to call upon his old comrades to
      supply the facts. For several nights they had sat with him, going over the
      scenes connected with their earliest acquaintance; those black days in
      Calcutta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia had brought over her father's notes and certain transcripts of
      letters he had written to her mother before their marriage. The four of
      them were putting these notes and narratives into chronological order.
      Brood, after three months of married life and frivolity, suddenly had
      decided to devote himself almost entirely to the completion of the
      journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He denied himself the theatre, the opera, and kindred features of the
      passing show, and, as he preferred to entertain rather than to be
      entertained, seldom found it necessary to go into the homes of other
      people. Yvonne made no protest. She merely pressed Frederic into service
      as an escort when she desired to go about, and thought nothing of it.
      Whatever James Brood's views of this arrangement were, he appeared to
      accept it good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lines had returned to the corners of his mouth and the old, hard
      look to his eyes. And there were times when he spoke harshly to his son;
      times when he purposely humbled him in the presence of others without
      apparent reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular night Yvonne had asked a few people in for dinner. They
      were people whom Brood liked especially well, but who did not appeal to
      her at all. As a matter of fact, they bored her. Yet she was happy in
      pleasing him. When she told him that they were coming he favoured her with
      a dry, rather impersonal smile and asked, with whimsical good humour, why
      she chose to punish herself for the sins of <i>his</i> youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her cheek against his and purred. For a moment he held his
      breath. Then the fire in his blood leaped into flame. He clasped the slim,
      adorable body in his strong arms and crushed her against his breast. She
      kissed him, and he was again the fierce, eager, unsated lover. It was one
      of their wonderful, imperishable moments, moments that brought oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he frequently did of late, he held her off at arm's length and
      searched her velvety eyes with a gaze that seemed to drag the very secrets
      out of her soul. She went deathly white and shivered. He took his hands
      from her shoulders and smiled. She came back into his arms like a dumb
      thing seeking protection, and continued to tremble as if frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      When company was being entertained downstairs Mr Dawes and Mr Riggs, with
      a fidelity to convention that was almost pitiful, invariably donned their
      evening clothes. They considered themselves remotely connected with the
      festivities, and, that being the case, the least they could do was to
      &ldquo;dress up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, they dressed with great care and deliberation. There was always
      the chance that they might be asked to come down; or, what was even more
      important, Mrs Brood might happen to encounter them in the upper hall, and
      in that event it was imperative that she should be made to realise how
      stupid she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually at nine o'clock they strolled into the study and smoked one of
      Brood's cigars with the gusto of real guests. It was their habit to
      saunter about the room, inspecting the treasures with critical, appraising
      eyes, very much as if they had never seen them before. They even handled
      some of the familiar objects with an air of bewilderment that would have
      done credit to a Cook's tourist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also a habit of theirs to try the doors of a large teakwood cabinet
      in one corner of the room. The doors were always locked, and they sighed
      with patient doggedness. Some time, they told themselves, Ranjab would
      forget to lock those doors, and then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes, after he had tried the doors on this particular
      occasion, &ldquo;I made a terrible mistake in letting poor Jim get married
      again. I'll never forgive myself.&rdquo; He had said this at least a hundred
      times during the past three months. Sometimes he cried over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danbury, old pal, you must not take all the blame for that. I am as much
      at fault as you, blast you!&rdquo; Mr Riggs always ended his confession with an
      explosion that fairly withered his friend and gave the lie to his attempt
      at humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; snapped Mr Dawes; &ldquo;curse me for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't make so much noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were ten years younger I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; blustered
      Dawes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Jack Desmond had lived,&rdquo; mused the other, paying no attention to
      the belligerent. &ldquo;He would have put a stop to this fool marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down and pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Jim had to marry someone, why didn't he marry right here at home?&rdquo;
       demanded Dawes, turning fiercely on his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Riggs, with significant solemnity, &ldquo;he is in the habit of
      marrying away from home. Look at the first one. He married her, didn't he?
      And see what came of it. He ought to have had more sense the second time.
      But marrying men never do get any sense. They just marry, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim's getting mighty cranky of late,&rdquo; ruminated Dawes, puffing away at
      his unlighted cigar. &ldquo;It's a caution the way he snaps Freddy off these
      days. He&mdash;he hates that boy, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sh&mdash;h!</i> Not so loud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you, don't you know a whisper when you hear it?&rdquo; demanded Dawes,
      who, in truth, had whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another potential silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddy goes about with her a good deal more than he ought to,&rdquo; said Riggs
      at last. &ldquo;They're together two-thirds of the time. Why&mdash;why, he heels
      her like a trained dog. Playing the pianner morning, noon, and night, and
      out driving, and going to the theatre, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've a notion to tell Jim he ought to put a stop to it,&rdquo; said the other.
      &ldquo;It makes me sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim'll do it without being told one o' these days, so you keep out of it.
      Say, have you noticed how piqued Lydia's looking these times? She's not
      the same girl, Dan; not the same girl. Something's wrong.&rdquo; He shook his
      head gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that dog-goned woman,&rdquo; announced Dawes explosively, and then looked
      over his shoulder with apprehension. A sigh of relief escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got no business coming in between Lydia and Freddy,&rdquo; said Riggs.
      &ldquo;Looks as though she's just set on busting it up. What can she possibly
      have against poor little Lydia? She's good enough for Freddy. Too good, by
      hokey! 'Specially when you stop to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't begin gossiping,&rdquo; warned Dawes, glaring at him. &ldquo;You're as bad
      as an old woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking ain't gossiping, confound you! If I wanted to gossip I'd up and
      say flatly that Jim Brood knows down in his soul that Freddy is no son of
      his. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've never heard him say so, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I can put two and two together. I'm no fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd advise you to shut up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you would, would you?&rdquo; with vast scorn. &ldquo;I'd like to know who it was
      that talked to Mrs Desmond about it. Who put it into her head that Jim
      doubts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, didn't she say I was a lying old busybody?&rdquo; snapped Danbury
      triumphantly. &ldquo;Didn't she call me down, eh? I'd like to know what more you
      could expect than that. Didn't she make me take back everything I said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did,&rdquo; said Riggs with conviction. &ldquo;And I believe she would have
      thrashed you if she'd been a man, just as she said she would. And didn't I
      advise her to do it, anyway, on the ground that you're an old woman and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's got nothing to do with the present case,&rdquo; interrupted Dawes
      hastily. &ldquo;What we ought to be thinking about now is how to get rid of this
      woman that's come in here to wreck our home. She's an interloper. She's a
      foreigner. She&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must admit she treats us very politely,&rdquo; said Riggs weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly she does. She has to. If she tried to come any of her
      high-and-mighty&mdash;ahem! Yes, Joseph, I consider Mrs Brood the
      loveliest, most charming&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the wind blowing the curtain, Danbury,&rdquo; said Riggs, reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; resumed his friend, &ldquo;I'd tell her what I thought of her
      almighty quick if she got uppish with me. The trouble is, she's so darned
      careful what she says to my face. I've never seen anybody as sweet as she
      is when she's with a feller. That all goes to prove that she's sly and
      unnatural. No woman ever lived who could be sweet all the time and still
      be as God made her. Why, she even comes up here and tries to be sweet on
      that 'Great Gawd Budd' thing over there. I heard her ask Ranjab one day
      why he never prostrated himself before the image.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Riggs, as the other paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't have sense enough to know that Ranjab is a Brahmin, a
      worshipper of Vishnu and Shiva. I also heard her say that you had been so
      drunk up here one night that a lady fainted when she saw you sprawled out
      on the couch. She thought you were dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been drunk in ten years! What's more, I don't remember ever
      having seen a strange woman in this room since I came here to visit Jim
      Brood, twelve years ago. She must be crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't say you saw the woman. She said the woman saw you,&rdquo; said Dawes
      witheringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one ever thought of locking that cupboard until she came,&rdquo; said Riggs,
      abruptly altering the trend of speech but not of thought. His gaze shifted
      to the cabinet. &ldquo;Jim is like wax in her hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no right to forget those days in Calcutta, when we shared our grog
      with him. No, Joe, we're not good enough for him in these days. She has
      bewitched him, poor devil. I've stuck to him like a brother for twenty
      years&mdash;both of us have for that matter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like twin brothers,&rdquo; amended Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. We don't forget those old days in Tibet, Turkestan, the Congo,
      the Sahara&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say we don't! Who is really writing this book of his? Who
      supplies all the most important facts? Who&mdash;who&mdash;well, that's
      all. Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do, old chap. But you'll find that we shan't have our names on the
      title-page. She'll see to that. She'll have us shunted off like a couple
      of deck-hands. Lydia can tell you how much of the material I have
      supplied. She knows, bless her heart. You furnished a lot, too, Joe, and
      John Desmond the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jim has done his share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll admit he has done all of the writing. I don't pose as a literary
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me he's sticking closer to the work than ever before,&rdquo; mused
      Riggs. &ldquo;We ought to finish it by spring, the way we're going now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still say, however, that he ought to put a stop to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop to what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her running around with Freddy. What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm in it, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I suppose not,&rdquo; the other reflected. &ldquo;Still they're pretty young, you
      know. Besides, she's French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was Joan of Arc,&rdquo; said his friend in rebuttal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Dawes leaned a little closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how Mrs Desmond likes having her over there playing the piano
      every afternoon with Freddy, while Lydia's over here copying things for
      Jim and working her poor little head off. Ever stop to think about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think about it all the time. And, by thunder, I'm not the only one who
      does, either. Jim thinks a good deal, and so does Lydia. It's a darned&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Riggs happened to look up at that instant. Ranjab was standing in front
      of him, his arms folded across his breast, in the habitual pose of the
      Hindu who waits. The man was dressed in the costume of a high-caste
      Brahmin; the commonplace garments of the Occident had been laid aside, and
      in their place were the vivid, dazzling colours of Ind, from the
      bejewelled sandals to the turban which crowned his swarthy brow and
      gleamed with rubies and sapphires uncounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Riggs's mouth remained open as he stared blankly at this ghost of
      another day. Not since the old days in India had he seen Ranjab in native
      garb, and even then he was far from being the resplendent creature of
      to-night, for Ranjab in his home land was a poor man and without
      distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I awake?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr Riggs in such an awful voice that Mr Dawes gave
      over staring at the cabinet and favoured him with an impatient kick on the
      ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that'll wake you up if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then he saw the Hindu.
      &ldquo;The Ranjab!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ranjab was smiling, and when he smiled his dark face was a joy to behold.
      His white teeth gleamed and his sometime unfeeling eyes sparkled with
      delight. He liked the two old men. They had stood, with Brood, between him
      and grave peril far back in the old days when even the faintest gleam of
      hope apparently had been blotted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; he cried, magnificently spreading his arms. &ldquo;I am made glorious!
      See before you the prince of magic! See!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a swift, deft movement he snatched the half-smoked cigar from the
      limp fingers of Mr Riggs and, first holding it before their blinking eyes,
      tossed it into the air. It disappeared!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr Riggs, sitting up very straight.
      His eyes were following the rapid actions of the Hindu. Unlocking a drawer
      in the big table, the latter peered into it and then beckoned the old men
      to his side. There lay the cigar and beside it a much-needed match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to smoke it,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs, vigorously declining his
      property. &ldquo;The darned thing's bewitched.&rdquo; Whereupon Ranjab took it out of
      the drawer and again threw it into the air. Then he calmly reached above
      his head and plucked a fresh cigar out of space, obsequiously tendering it
      to the amazed old man, who accepted it with a sheepish grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't lost any of your old skill,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes, involuntarily
      glancing at his own cigar to make sure that he had it firmly gripped in
      his stubby fingers. &ldquo;You ought to be in a sideshow, Ranjab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ranjab paused, before responding, to extract a couple of billiard balls
      and a small paper-knife from the lapel of Dawes's coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to perform to-night, <i>sahib</i>, for the mistress's guests. It is
      to be&mdash;what you call him? A side-show? Ranjab is to do his tricks for
      her, as the dog performs for his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile had disappeared. His face was an impenetrable mask once more.
      Had their eyes been young and keen, however, they might have caught the
      flash of anger in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to do all the old tricks?&rdquo; cried Mr Riggs eagerly. &ldquo;By George, I'd
      like to see 'em again; wouldn't you, Dan? I'm glad we've got our good
      clothes on. Now you see what comes of always being prepared for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, <i>sahib</i>, but the master has request me to entertain you
      before the guests come up. Coffee is to be served here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means we'll have to clear out?&rdquo; said Riggs slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But see!&rdquo; cried Ranjab, genuinely sorry for them. He became enthusiastic
      once more. &ldquo;See! I shall do them all&mdash;and better, too, for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For ten minutes he astonished the old men with the mysterious feats of the
      Indian fakir. They waxed enthusiastic. He grinned over the pleasure he was
      giving them. Suddenly he whipped out a short, thin sword from its scabbard
      in his sash. The amazing, incomprehensible sword-swallowing act followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Ranjab has not forgot,&rdquo; he cried in triumph. &ldquo;He have not lost
      the touch of the wizard, <i>aih</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll lose your gizzard some day, doing that,&rdquo; said Dawes grimly. &ldquo;It
      gives me the shivers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, before their startled, horror-struck eyes, the Hindu coolly plunged
      the glittering blade into his breast, driving it in to the hilt!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; shouted the two old men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranjab serenely replaced the sword in its scabbard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not always the knife that finds the heart,&rdquo; said he, so slowly, so
      full of meaning, that even the old men grasped the significance of the
      cryptic remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A feller can be fooled, no matter how closely he watches,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes,
      and he was not referring to the amazing sword trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs, with gloomy irrelevance, &ldquo;I don't like that
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old spell of the Orient had fallen upon the ancients. They were
      hearing the vague whisperings of voices that came from nowhere, as they
      had heard them years ago in the mystic silences of the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sh&mdash;h!</i> One comes,&rdquo; said Ranjab softly. &ldquo;It will be the
      master's son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An instant later his closet door closed noiselessly behind him and the old
      men were alone, blinking at each other. There was no sound from the hall.
      They waited, watching the curtained door. At last they heard footsteps on
      the stairs, quick footsteps of the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic strode rapidly into the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>is face was livid
      with rage. For a moment he glowered upon the two old men, his fingers
      working spasmodically, his chest heaving with the volcanic emotions he was
      trying so hard to subdue. Then he whirled about to glare into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God's name, Freddy, what's happened?&rdquo; cried Mr Riggs, all a-tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had never seen him in a rage before. There had been occasions when
      they had secretly criticised James Brood's treatment of the unhappy boy,
      but from the youth himself there had come no complaint, only the hurt,
      puzzled look of one who endures because an alternative does not suggest
      itself. Intuitively the old men knew that his present condition was due to
      something his father had said or done, and that it must have been
      unusually severe to have provoked the wrath that he made no effort to
      conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not in their honest old hearts to hold grievance against the lad,
      notwithstanding his frequent periods of impatience where they were
      concerned, periods when they were admittedly as much at fault as he, by
      the way. Usually he made up for these lapses by a protracted season of
      sweetness and consideration that won back not only their sympathy, but the
      affection they had felt for him since his lonely boyhood days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes passed before he could trust himself to speak. Ugly veins
      stood out on his pale temples as he paced the floor in front of them.
      Eventually Mr Dawes ventured the vital question in a somewhat hushed
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you&mdash;quarrelled with your father, Freddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man threw up his arms in a gesture of despair. There was a wail
      of misery in his voice as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God, why should he hate me as he does? What have I done?
      Am I not a good son to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; implored Mr Dawes nervously. &ldquo;He'll hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me!&rdquo; cried Frederic, and laughed aloud in his recklessness. &ldquo;Why
      shouldn't he hear me? I'll not stand it a day longer. He wouldn't think of
      treating a dog as he treats me. I&mdash;I&mdash;why, he is actually
      forcing me to hate him. I <i>do</i> hate him! I swear to Heaven it was in
      my heart to kill him down there just now. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He could
      not go on. He choked up and the tears rushed to his eyes. Abruptly turning
      away, he threw himself upon the couch and buried his face on his arms,
      sobbing like a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old men, distressed beyond the power of speech, mumbled incoherent
      words of comfort as they slowly edged toward the door. They tiptoed into
      the hall, and neither spoke until their bedroom door was closed behind
      them. Mr Dawes even tried it to see that it was safely latched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's got to come,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs, wiping his eyes but neglecting to blow
      his nose&mdash;recollecting in good time the vociferous noise that always
      attended the performance. &ldquo;Yes, sir; it's bound to come. There's going to
      be a smash, mark my words. It can't go on.&rdquo; He sat down heavily and stared
      rather pathetically at his friend, who was the picture of lugubrious
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes bleakly, &ldquo;as sure as you're alive, Joey. That
      boy's spunk is going to assert itself some day, and then&mdash;good Lord,
      what then? He'll curse Jim to his teeth and&mdash;and Jim'll up and tell
      him the truth. I&mdash;I don't know what will happen then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Riggs swallowed hard&mdash;a gulping sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddy's the kind of a feller who'll kill himself, Danny. He's as high
      strung as a harp. Something will snap. I hate to think of it. Poor lad! It&mdash;it
      ain't his fault that things are not as they ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Jim Brood ever tells him he's no son of his, he'll break the boy's
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so sure of that,&rdquo; said Riggs sagely. &ldquo;Sometimes I think Freddy
      would be darned glad to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curtains parted and Yvonne looked in upon the wretched Frederic. There
      was a look of mingled pain and commiseration in her wide-open eyes. For a
      moment she stood there regarding him in silence. Then she swiftly crossed
      the room to the couch in the corner, where he sat huddled up, his
      shoulders still shaking with the misery that racked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes darkened into the hungry, yearning look of one who would gladly
      share or assume all of the suffering of another whose happiness was dear
      to her&mdash;the look of a gentle mother. The mocking, seductive gleam was
      gone, and in its place was the glow of infinite pity. Her hand went out to
      touch the tousled hair, but stopped before contact. Slowly she drew back,
      with a glance of apprehension toward the door of the Hindu's closet. An
      odd expression of alarm crept into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic,&rdquo; she said softly, almost timorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his head quickly and then sprang to his feet. His eyes were wet
      and his lips were drawn. Shame possessed him. He tried to smile, but it
      was a pitiful failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so ashamed of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began in a choked voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashamed because you have cried?&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;But no! It is good to
      cry; it is good for men to cry. But when a strong man breaks down and
      sheds tears, I am&mdash;oh, I am heartbroken. A woman's tears mean
      nothing, but a man's? Oh, they are terrible! But come! You must compose
      yourself. The others will be here in a few minutes. I ran away from them
      on the pretext that I&mdash;but it is of no consequence. It is enough that
      I am here. You must go to your room and bathe your face. Go at once.
      Your father must not know that you have cried. He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse him!&rdquo; came from between Frederic's clenched teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she cried, with another glance at Ranjab's door. She would have
      given much to know whether the Hindu was there or still below-stairs. &ldquo;You
      must not say such&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say it, Yvonne&mdash;I'll say it to his face! I don't care if the
      others do see that I have been crying. I want them to know how he hurts
      me, and I want them to hate him for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake, Frederic, calm yourself. I implore you to go to your room.
      Come back later, but go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was struck by the seriousness in her voice and manner. An ugly, crooked
      smile writhed about the corners of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you're trying to smooth it over so that they won't consider him
      a brute. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Please, please! You know that my heart aches for you, <i>mon ami</i>.
      It was cruel of him, it was cowardly&mdash;yes, cowardly! Now I have said
      it!&rdquo; She drew herself up and turned deliberately toward the little door
      across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes brightened. The crooked sneer turned into an imploring smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Yvonne! You must see that I'm beside myself. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must be sensible. Remember he is your father. He is a strange
      man. There has been a great deal of bitterness in his life. He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I been the cause of a moment's bitterness to him?&rdquo; cried Frederic.
      &ldquo;Why should he hate me? Why&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are losing control of yourself again, Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't go on the way things are now. He's getting to be worse than
      ever. I never have a kind word from him, seldom a word of any description.
      Never a kind look. Can't you understand how it goads me to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! You've said all this before, and I have listened to you when I
      should have reminded you that he is my husband,&rdquo; she said impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, I don't see how you can love him!&rdquo; he cried boldly. &ldquo;Sometimes
      I wonder if you do love him. He is as selfish, as unfeeling as oh, there's
      no word for it. Why, in the name of God, did you ever marry such a man?
      You couldn't have loved him.&rdquo; Something in her expression brought him up
      sharply. Her eyes had narrowed; they had the look of a wary, hunted thing
      that has been driven into a corner. He stared. &ldquo;Forgive me, Yvonne. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you are saying,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;Are you accusing me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! What a coward, what a dog I am!&rdquo; he cried abjectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A queer little smile stole into her face. It was even more baffling than
      the expression it displaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your friend,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Is this the way to reward me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped to his knees and covered her hands with kisses, mumbling his
      plea for forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so terribly unhappy,&rdquo; he said over and over again. &ldquo;I'd leave this
      house to-night if it were not that I can't bear the thought of leaving
      you, Yvonne. I adore you. You are everything in the world to me. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; she cried out sharply. He lifted his eyes in dumb wonder and
      adoration, but not in time to catch the look of triumph that swept across
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive me?&rdquo; he cried, coming to his feet. &ldquo;I&mdash;I couldn't
      help saying it. It was wrong&mdash;wrong! But you <i>will</i> forgive me,
      Yvonne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, walking slowly toward the door. He remained rooted to the
      spot, blushing with shame and dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going? To tell <i>him?</i>&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply at once, but drew the <i>portières</i> apart and peered
      down the stairs beyond, her attitude one of tense anxiety. As she faced
      him a smile of security was on her lips. She leaned gracefully against the
      jamb of the door, her arms dropping to her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will forgive you,&rdquo; she said calmly, and he realised in a flash
      that the verdict would have been different if there had been the remotest
      chance that his declaration was overheard. She would have denied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I adore you, Yvonne,&rdquo; he cried in low tones, striding swiftly toward her,
      only to halt as he caught the smile of derision in her eyes. &ldquo;I don't mean
      it in the way you think. You are so good to me. You have given me so much
      joy and happiness, and&mdash;and you understand me so well. I could die
      for you, Yvonne. I <i>would</i> die for you. It's not the kind of love you
      are in the habit of commanding, you who are so glorious and so beautiful.
      It's the love of a dog for his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited an instant, and then came toward him. He never could have
      explained the unaccountable impulse that forced him to fall back a few
      steps as she approached. Her eyes were gazing steadily into his, and her
      red lips were parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as it should be,&rdquo; she was saying, but he was never sure that he
      heard the words. His knees grew weak. He was in the toils! &ldquo;Now you must
      pull yourself together,&rdquo; she went on, in such a matter-of-fact tone that
      he straightened up involuntarily. &ldquo;Come! Wipe the tear-stains from your
      cheeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, but his lip still quivered with the rage that had been checked
      by the ascendancy of another and even more devastating emotion. She was
      standing quite close to him now, her slender figure swaying slightly as if
      moved by some strange, rhythmic melody to which the heart beat time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were soft and velvety again, her smile tender and appealing. The
      vivid white of her arms and shoulders seemed to shed a soft light about
      her, so radiant was the sheen of the satin skin. Her gown was of black
      velvet, cut very low, and with scarcely any ornamentation save the great
      cluster of rubies at the top of her corsage. They gleamed like coals of
      fire against the skin, which appeared to absorb and reflect their warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a full red rose in her dark hair. She wore no ear-rings, no
      finger-rings except the narrow gold band on her left hand. A wide,
      exquisitely designed gold bracelet fitted tightly about her right forearm,
      as if it had been welded to the soft white flesh. Yvonne's ears were
      lovely; she knew better than to disfigure them. Her hands were
      incomparably beautiful; she knew their full value unadorned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved closer to him and with deft fingers applied her tiny lace
      handkerchief to his flushed cheeks and eyes, laughing audibly as she did
      so; a low gurgle of infinite sweetness and concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood like a statue, scarcely breathing, the veins in his throat
      throbbing violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, and deliberately touched the <i>mouchoir</i> to her own
      smiling lips before replacing it in her bodice next to the warm, soft
      skin. &ldquo;Lydia must not see that her big baby sweetheart has been crying,&rdquo;
       she went on, and if there was mockery in her voice it was lost on him. He
      could only stare as if bereft of all his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking, Frederic,&rdquo; she said, suddenly serious, &ldquo;perhaps it
      would be better if we were not alone when the others come up. Go at once
      and fetch the two old men. Tell them I expect them here to witness the
      magic. It appears to be a family party, so why exclude them? Be quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dashed off to obey her command. She lighted a cigarette at the table,
      her unsmiling eyes fixed on the door to the Hindu's closet. Then, with a
      little sigh, she sank down on the broad couch and stretched her supple
      body in the ecstasy of complete relaxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene at the dinner-table had been most distressing. Up to the instant
      of the outburst her husband had been in singularly gay spirits, a
      circumstance so unusual that the whole party wondered not a little. If the
      others were vaguely puzzled by his high humour, not so Yvonne. She
      understood him better than anyone else in the world; she read his mind as
      she would have read an open book.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was riot, not joy, in the heart of the brilliant talker at the head
      of the table. He was talking against the savagery that strained so hard at
      its leash.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her right sat Frederic, at her left the renowned Dr Hodder, whose feats
      at the operating table were vastly more successful than his efforts at the
      dinner-table. He was a very wonderful surgeon, but equally famous as a
      bore of the first rank. Yvonne could not endure him. His jokes were
      antediluvian, and his laughter over them an abomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an impression, as many famous men have, that the sole duty of a
      dinner guest is to be funny in the loudest voice possible, drowning out
      all competition, and to talk glowingly about the soup, as if nothing else
      was required to convince the hostess that he considered her dinner
      irreproachable and her cook a jewel. Still, it was agreed Dr Hodder was a
      wonderful surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Desmond and Lydia were there. (This was an excellent opportunity to
      entertain them on an occasion of more or less magnitude.) There were also
      present Bertie Gunning and his pretty wife, Maisie, both of whom Yvonne
      liked; and the Followed sisters, with two middle-aged gentlemen from one
      of the clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Followed was forty, and proved it by cheerfully discussing events
      that happened at least that far back in her life. Her sister Janey was
      much younger, quite pretty, and acutely ingenuous. The middle-aged
      gentlemen ate very little. They were going to a supper at the
      Knickerbocker later on for someone whose name was Lilly. Occasionally it
      was Lil. It rather gratified them to be chided about the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic, deceived by his father's sprightly mood, entered rather
      recklessly into the lively discussion. He seldom took his eyes from the
      face of his beautiful stepmother, and many of his remarks were uttered <i>sotto
      voce</i> for her ear alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly James Brood called out his name in a sharp, commanding tone.
      Frederic, at the moment engaged in a low exchange of words with Yvonne,
      did not hear him. Brood spoke again, loudly, harshly. There was dead
      silence at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will excuse you, Frederic,&rdquo; said he, a deadly calm in his voice. The
      puzzled expression in the young man's face slowly gave way to a steady
      glare of fury. He could not trust himself to speak. &ldquo;I regret exceedingly
      that you cannot take wine in moderation. A breath of fresh air will be of
      benefit to you. You may join us upstairs later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't drunk a full glass of champagne,&rdquo; began the young man in amazed
      protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood smiled indulgently, but there was a sinister gleam in his gray eyes.
      &ldquo;I think you had better take my advice,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said Frederic in a low, suppressed voice, his face
      paling. Without another word he got up from the table and walked out of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke the truth later on when he told Yvonne that he could not
      understand. But she understood. She knew that James Brood had endured the
      situation as long as it was in his power to endure, and she knew that it
      was her fault entirely that poor Frederic had been exposed to this
      crowning bit of humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat in the dim study awaiting her stepson's reappearance with the
      two old men, her active, far-seeing mind was striving to estimate the cost
      of that tragic clash. Not the cost to herself or to Frederic, but to James
      Brood!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Messrs Dawes and Riggs, inordinately pleased over the rehabitation,
      were barely through delivering themselves of their protestations of
      undying fealty when the sound of voices came up from the lower hall.
      Frederic started to leave the room, not caring to face those who had
      witnessed his unwarranted degradation. Yvonne hurried to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she cried sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot expect me to stay here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But certainly!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Listen! I will tell you what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sank to an imperative whisper. He listened in sheer amazement,
      his face growing dark with rebellion as she proceeded to unfold her plan
      for a present victory over his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I can't do that! Never, Yvonne,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake, Freddy. Don't forget that you owe something to me. I command
      you to do as I tell you. It is the only way. Make haste! Open the window,
      get the breath of air he prescribed, and when they are all here, <i>apologise
      for your condition!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dr Hodder and Mrs Gunning entered the room a few minutes later young
      Brood was standing in the open window, drinking in the cold night air, and
      she was blithely regaling the blinking old men with an account of her
      stepson's unhappy efforts to drink all the wine in sight! As she told it,
      it was a most amusing experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Brood was the last to enter, with Miss Followed. He took in the
      situation at a glance. Was it relief that sprang into his eyes as he saw
      the two old men?
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic came down from the window, somewhat too swiftly for one who is
      moved by shame and contrition, and faced the group with a well-assumed
      look of mortification in his pale, twitching face. He spoke in low,
      repressed tones, but not once did he permit his gaze to encounter that of
      his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry to have made a nuisance of myself. It does go to my
      head, and I&mdash;I dare say the heat of the room helped to do the work.
      I'm all right now, however. The fresh air did me a lot of good. Hope
      you'll all overlook my foolish attempt to be a devil of a fellow.&rdquo; He
      hesitated a moment and then went on, more clearly. &ldquo;I'm all right now,
      father. It shall not happen again, I can promise you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A close observer might have seen the muscles of his jaw harden as he
      uttered the final sentence. He intended that his father should take it as
      a threat, not as an apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood was watching him closely, a puzzled expression in his eyes;
      gradually it developed into something like admiration. In the clamour of
      voices that ensued the older man detected the presence of an underlying
      note of censure for his own behaviour. For the first time in many years he
      experienced a feeling of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone was speaking at his elbow. Janey, in her young,
      enthusiastic voice, shrilled something into his ear that caused him to
      look at her in utter amazement. It was so astounding that he could not
      believe he heard aright. He mumbled in a questioning tone, &ldquo;I beg your
      pardon,&rdquo; and she repeated her remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wonderfully like you Frederic is, Mr Brood.&rdquo; Then she added: &ldquo;Do you
      know, I've never noticed it until to-night? It's really remarkable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Brood responded somewhat icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think so, Mr Brood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not, Miss Janey,&rdquo; said he distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maisie Gunning was speaking of it just a few minutes ago,&rdquo; went on the
      girl, unimpressed. &ldquo;She says you are very much alike when you are&mdash;are&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       here she foundered in sudden confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intoxicated?&rdquo; he inquired, without a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blushed painfully. &ldquo;No, no! When you are angry. There, I suppose I
      shouldn't have said it, but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a most gratifying discovery,&rdquo; said he, and turned to speak to Mrs
      Desmond. He did not take his gaze from Frederic's white, set face,
      however; and, despite the fact that he knew the girl had uttered an idle
      commonplace, he was annoyed to find himself studying the features of
      Matilde's boy with an interest that seemed almost laughable when he
      considered it later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      His guests found much to talk about in the room. He was soon being dragged
      from one object to another and ordered to reveal the history, the use, and
      the nature of countless things that obviously were intended to be just
      what they seemed; such as rugs, shields, lamps, and so forth. He was ably
      assisted by Messrs Riggs and Dawes, who lied prodigiously in a frenzy of
      rivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a perfectly delightful Buddha!&rdquo; cried Miss Janey, stopping in front
      of the idol. &ldquo;How perfectly lovely he is&mdash;or is it a she, Mr Brood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply at once. His eyes were on Frederic and Yvonne, who had
      come together at last and were conversing earnestly apart from the rest of
      the group. He observed that Lydia was standing quite alone near the table,
      idly handling a magazine. To the best of his recollection, Frederic had
      scarcely spoken to the girl during the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is where I work and play and dream, Miss Janey, and practise the
      ogre's art. It is a forbidden chamber, my sanctuary,&rdquo;&mdash;with a glance
      at the idol&mdash;&ldquo;and here is where I sometimes chop off pretty young
      women's heads and hang them from the window-ledge as a warning to all
      other birds of prey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Janey laughed gleefully, attracting Yvonne's attention. Then she sang
      out across the room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband says he is an ogre. Is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne came languidly toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband manages to keep me in his enchanted castle without chains and
      padlocks, and that is saying a great deal in this day and age, my dear.
      Would you call him an ogre after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is the old story of the fairy queen and the ogre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure I'd be an ogre if there was no other way of keeping you,
      my dear,&rdquo; said Brood. There was something in his voice that caused her to
      look up into his face quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr Hodder, being a wonderful surgeon, managed to cut his finger with a
      razor-edged kris at that instant, drawing a little shriek from Miss
      Followed, to whom he was jocularly explaining that scientific Malays used
      the thing in removing one another's appendices, the surgeon being the one
      who survived the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the excitement incident to the bloodletting the middle-aged
      gentlemen glanced furtively at their watches and indulged in a mental
      calculation from which they emerged somewhat easier in their minds. It
      still wanted an hour before the theatres were out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful bore,&rdquo; yawned one of them behind his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupidest woman I ever sat next to,&rdquo; said the other,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then both looked at their watches again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic joined Lydia at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A delicious scene, wasn't it?&rdquo; he asked bitterly in lowered tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers touched his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he mean, Freddy? Oh, I felt so sorry for you. It was dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't take it so seriously, Lyddy,&rdquo; he said, squeezing her hand gently.
      Both of them realised that it was the nearest thing to a caress that had
      passed between them in a fortnight or longer. A wave of shame swept
      through him. &ldquo;Dear old girl&mdash;my dear old girl,&rdquo; he whispered
      brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes radiated joy, her lips parted in a wan, tremulous smile of
      surprise, and a soft sigh escaped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, dear boy,&rdquo; she murmured, and was happier than she had been in
      weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, old chap,&rdquo; said one of the middle-aged gentlemen, again
      consulting his watch as he loudly addressed his host, &ldquo;can't you hurry
      this performance of yours along a bit? It is after ten, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quarter after,&rdquo; said the other middle-aged gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will summon the magician,&rdquo; said Brood. &ldquo;Be prepared, ladies and
      gentlemen, to meet the devil. Ranjab is the prince of darkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his hand to strike the gong that stood near the edge of the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily four pairs of eyes fastened their gaze upon the door to the
      Hindu's closet. Three mellow, softly reverberating &ldquo;booms&rdquo; filled the
      room. Almost instantly the voice of the Hindu was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Aih, sahib!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came swiftly into the room from the hall, and not from his closet. The
      look of relief in Yvonne's eyes was short-lived. She saw amazement in the
      faces of the two old men&mdash;and knew!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After we have had the feats of magic,&rdquo; Brood was saying, &ldquo;Miss Desmond
      will read to you, ladies and gentlemen, that chapter of our journal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; groaned both of the middle-aged gentlemen, looking at their
      watches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relating to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to excuse me, Brood, really, you know. Important engagement
      up-town&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Cruger,&rdquo; exclaimed Hodder. &ldquo;The lady won't miss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relating to our first encounter with the great and only Ranjab,&rdquo; pursued
      Brood oracularly. &ldquo;We found him in a little village far up in the
      mountains. He was under the sentence of death for murder. By the way,
      Yvonne, the kris you have in your hand is the very weapon the good fellow
      used in the commission of his crime. He was in prison and was to die
      within a fortnight after our arrival in the town. I heard of his unhappy
      plight and all that had led up to it. His case interested me tremendously.
      One night, a week before the proposed execution, my friends and I stormed
      the little prison and rescued him. We were just getting over the cholera
      and needed excitement. That was fifteen years ago. He has been my trusted
      body-servant ever since. I am sure you will be interested in what I have
      written about that thrilling adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne had dropped the ugly knife upon the table as if it were a thing
      that scorched her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he&mdash;really kill a man?&rdquo; whispered Miss Janey with horror in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He killed a woman. His wife, Miss Janey. She had been faithless, you see.
      He cut her heart out. And now, Ranjab, are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Hindu salaamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ranjab is always ready, <i>sahib</i>,&rdquo; said he.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next day, after
      a sleepless night, Frederic announced to his stepmother that he could no
      longer remain under his father's roof. He would find something to do in
      order to support himself. It was impossible to go on pretending that he
      loved or respected his father, and the sooner the farce was ended the
      better it would be for both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, too, had passed a restless night. She slept but little. It was a
      night filled with waking dreams as well as those which came in sleep.
      There was always an ugly, wriggly kris in those dreams of hers, and a
      brown hand that was for ever fascinating her with its uncanny deftness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice in the night she had clutched her husband's shoulder in the terror
      of a dream, and he had soothed her with the comfort of his strong arms.
      She crept close to him and slept again, secure for the moment against the
      sorcery that haunted her. He had been surprised, even gratified, when she
      came into his room long after midnight, to creep shivering into his bed.
      She was like a little child &ldquo;afraid of the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her influence alone prevented the young man from carrying out his threat.
      At first he was as firm as a rock in his determination. He was getting his
      few possessions together in his room when she tapped on his door. After a
      while he abandoned the task and followed her rather dazedly to the
      boudoir, promising to listen to reason. For an hour she argued and pleaded
      with him, and in the end he agreed to give up what she was pleased to call
      his preposterous plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that being settled,&rdquo; she said with a sigh of relief, &ldquo;let us go and
      talk it all over with Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd&mdash;I'd rather not, Yvonne,&rdquo; he said, starting guiltily. &ldquo;There's
      no use worrying her with the thing now. As a matter of fact, I'd prefer
      that she&mdash;well, somehow I don't like the idea of explaining matters to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked away. He realised that he could not explain the thing even to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I don't want her to know that I thought of leaving,&rdquo; he
      supplemented. &ldquo;She wouldn't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's so open and above-board about everything,&rdquo; he explained nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has seemed to me of late, Frederic, that you and Lydia are not quite
      so&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;so enamoured of each other. What has happened?&rdquo;
       she inquired so innocently, so naïvely, that he looked at her in
      astonishment. She was watching him narrowly. &ldquo;I am sure you fairly live at
      her house. You are there nearly every day, and yet&mdash;well, I can feel
      rather than see the change in both of you. I hope&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been behaving like an infernal sneak, Yvonne!&rdquo; cried he,
      conscience-stricken. &ldquo;She's the finest, noblest girl in all this world,
      and I've been treating her shamefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! In what way, may I inquire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we used to&mdash;oh, but why go into all that? It would only amuse
      you. You'd laugh at us for silly fools. But I can't help saying this much:
      she doesn't deserve to be treated as I'm treating her now, Yvonne. It's
      hurting her dreadfully, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing that she should be so dreadfully afflicted?&rdquo; she
      cried ironically.
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been neglecting her, ignoring her, humiliating
      her, if you will force me to say it,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;Good Lord, if
      anyone had told me three months ago that I'd ever be guilty of giving
      Lydia an instant's pain, I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would do what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't laugh at me, Yvonne,&rdquo; he cried miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became serious at once. &ldquo;Do you still love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; he shouted, as if there was some necessity for convincing
      himself as well as his listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she loves you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;certainly! At least I think she does,&rdquo; he floundered. His
      forehead was moist and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why this sudden misgiving, this feeling of doubt, this
      self-abasement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand it myself,&rdquo; he said rather bleakly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I give
      you my word, I don't know what has come over me. I'm not as I used to be.
      I'm&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed softly. &ldquo;I'm afraid you are seeing too much of your poor
      stepmother,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes narrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've made me over, that's true. You've made all of us over&mdash;the
      house as well. I am not happy unless I am with you. It used to make me
      happy to be with Lydia&mdash;and we were always together. But I&mdash;I
      don't care now&mdash;at least, I am not unhappy when we are apart. You've
      done it, Yvonne. You've made life worth living. You've made me see
      everything differently. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood up, facing him. She appeared to be frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you trying to tell me that you are in love with me?&rdquo; she demanded,
      and there was no longer mockery or raillery in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes swept her from head to foot. He was deathly white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were not my father's wife I would say yes,&rdquo; said he hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what it is that you have said?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly putting
      her hands to her temples. Her eyes were glowing like coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a dear boy, Frederic, but you are a foolish one,&rdquo; she went on,
      the smile struggling back to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you'll send me away after&mdash;what I've said,&rdquo; he muttered
      dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I shall pay no attention to such nonsense. You
      are an honest fool, and I don't blame you. Wiser men than you have fallen
      in love with me, so why not you? I like you, Freddy; I like you very, very
      much. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like me because I am his son!&rdquo; he cried hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were not his son I should despise you,&rdquo; she said deliberately,
      cruelly. He winced. &ldquo;There, now; we've said enough. You must be sensible.
      You will discover that I am <i>very, very</i> sensible. I have been sorry
      for you. It may hurt you to have me say that I pity you; but I do. You do
      not love me, Freddy. You are fooling yourself. You are like all boys when
      they lose their heads and not their hearts. It is Lydia whom you love, not
      I. You have just told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before Heaven, Yvonne, I <i>do</i> love her. That's what I cannot
      understand about myself.&rdquo; He was pacing the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>I</i> understand,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Now go away, please. And
      don't let me hear another word about your leaving your father's house. You
      are not to take that step until I command you to go. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her in utter bewilderment for a moment, and slowly nodded his
      head. Then he turned abruptly toward the door, shamed and humiliated
      beyond words.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went swiftly down the stairs his father came out upon the landing
      above and leaned over the railing to watch his descent. A moment later
      Brood was knocking at Yvonne's door. He did not wait for an invitation to
      enter, but strode into the room without ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing at the window that opened out upon the little stone
      balcony, and had turned swiftly at the sound of the rapping. Surprise gave
      way to an expression of displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Frederic been saying to you?&rdquo; demanded her husband curtly, after
      he had closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint sneer came to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my dear James, that you would care to know,&rdquo; she said,
      smouldering anger in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean something that I <i>shouldn't</i> know,&rdquo; he said sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not forgetting yourself, James?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. I suppose the implication was offensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was. You have no right to pry into my affairs, James, and I shall be
      grateful to you if you will refrain from doing so again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! Are you trying to tell me what I shall do or say&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am merely reminding you that I am your wife, not your&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       She did not deem it necessary to complete the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are content to leave a good deal to my imagination, I see.&rdquo; He
      flushed angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came up to him slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James, we must both be careful. We must not quarrel.&rdquo; Her hands grasped
      the lapels of his long lounging robe. There was an appealing look in her
      eyes that checked the harsh words even as they rose to his lips. He found
      himself looking into those dark eyes with the same curious wonder in his
      own that had become so common of late. Time and again he had been puzzled
      by something he saw in their liquid depths, something that he could not
      fathom, no matter how deeply he probed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there about you, Yvonne, that hurts me&mdash;yes actually hurts
      me&mdash;when you look at me as you're looking now?&rdquo; he cried almost
      roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been married a scant four months,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;Would you
      expect a woman to shed her mystery in so short a time as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something in your eyes&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and shook
      his head in utter perplexity. &ldquo;You startle me once in a while. There are
      times when you seem to be looking at me through eyes that are not your
      own. It's&mdash;it's&mdash;quite uncanny. If you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you my eyes are all my own,&rdquo; she cried flippantly, and yet there
      was a slight trace of nervousness in her manner. &ldquo;Do you intend to be nice
      and good and reasonable, James? I mean about poor Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face clouded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you are doing to that boy?&rdquo; he asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite as well as I know what you are doing to him,&rdquo; she replied quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stiffened. &ldquo;Can't you see what it is coming to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He was on the point of leaving your house, never to come back to it
      again. That's what it is coming to,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was packing his things to go away to-day&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, he'd starve!&rdquo; cried the man, shaken in spite of himself.
      &ldquo;He has never done a day's labour; he doesn't know how to earn a living.
      He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is to blame? You, James; you! You have tied his hands, you have
      penned him up in&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not go into that,&rdquo; he interrupted coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. As you please. I said that he was going away, perhaps to
      starve, but he has changed his mind. He has taken my advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have advised him to bide his time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds rather ominous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he waits long enough you may discover that you love him and his going
      would give you infinite pain. Then is the time for him to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; he cried in astonishment. &ldquo;What a remarkable notion of the
      fitness&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be his chance to repay you for all that you have done for him,
      James,&rdquo; said she, as calm as a May morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I ever said that I do not love him?&rdquo; he demanded shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that matter, have you ever said that you do not hate him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, you are a puzzle to me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and a fine moisture came
      out on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the boy alone, James,&rdquo; she went on earnestly. &ldquo;He is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Yvonne,&rdquo; he broke in sternly, &ldquo;that is a matter we can't
      discuss. You do not understand, and I cannot explain certain things to
      you. I came here just now to ask you to be fair to him, even though I may
      not appear to be. You are&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is also a matter we cannot discuss,&rdquo; said she calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a thing we are going to discuss, just the same,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Sit
      down, my dear, and listen to what I have to say. Sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she faced him defiantly. He was no longer angry, and therein
      lay the strength that opposed her. She could have held her own with him if
      he had maintained the angry attitude that marked the beginning of their
      interview. As it was, her eyes fell after a brief struggle against the
      dominant power in his, and she obeyed, but not without a significant
      tribute to his superiority in the shape of an indignant shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has ever lectured me before, James,&rdquo; she said, affecting a yawn.
      &ldquo;It will be a new and interesting experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I trust a profitable one,&rdquo; said he rather grimly. &ldquo;I shouldn't call
      it a lecture, however. A warning is better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That should be more thrilling, in any event.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took one of her hands in his and stroked it gently, even patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come straight to the point. Frederic is falling in love with you.
      Wait! I do not blame him. He cannot help himself. No more could I, for
      that matter, and he has youth, which is a spur that I have lost. I have
      watched him, Yvonne. He is&mdash;to put it cold-bloodedly&mdash;losing his
      head. Leaving me out of the question altogether, if you choose, do you
      think you are quite fair to him? I am not disturbed on your account or my
      own, but&mdash;well, can't you see what a cruel position we are likely to find
      ourselves&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, James,&rdquo; she interrupted, sitting up very straight in the
      chair and meeting his gaze steadfastly. &ldquo;Will you spare me the conjectures
      and come straight to the point as you have said? The warning, if you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned a shade paler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began deliberately, &ldquo;it comes to this, my dear: one or the
      other of you will have to leave my house if this thing goes on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shot a glance of incredulity at his set face. Her body became rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would serve me as you served his real mother more than twenty years
      ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cases are not parallel,&rdquo; said he, wincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You drove her out of your house, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said that we cannot discuss&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I choose to discuss it,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;The truth, please. You
      drove her out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She made her bed, Yvonne,&rdquo; said he huskily.
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you warn her
      beforehand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it wasn't necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her crime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, Yvonne! I can't allow&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it as great as mine?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is ridiculous. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she leave you cheerfully, gladly, as I would go if I loved another,
      or did she plead with you&mdash;oh, I know it hurts! Did she plead with
      you to give her a chance to explain? Did she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was on her knees to me,&rdquo; he said, the veins standing out on his
      temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On her knees to you? Begging? For what? Forgiveness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! She was like all of her kind. She was innocent! Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne arose. She stood over him like an accusing angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to this day, James Brood, to this very hour, you are not certain that
      you did right in casting her off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; He sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never really convinced yourself that she was untrue to you, in
      spite of all that you said and did at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going too far! I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these years you have been trying to close your ears to the voice of
      that wretched woman, and all these years you have been wondering&mdash;wondering&mdash;wondering!
      You have been mortally afraid, my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, I was certain&mdash;I was sure of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you still love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her open-mouthed, speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you still love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Good God, woman, how can you ask that question
      of me, knowing that I love you with all my heart and soul? How&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all your heart, yes! But with your soul? No! That other woman has
      your soul. I have heard your soul speak, and it speaks of her&mdash;yes,
      to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God's name, what&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Night after night, in your sleep, James Brood, you have cried out to
      'Matilde.' You have sobbed out your love for her, as you have been doing
      for twenty years or more. In your sleep your soul has been with her. With
      me at your side, you have cried on 'Matilde'! You have passed your hand
      over my face and murmured 'Matilde'! Not once have you uttered the word
      'Yvonne'! And now you come to me and say: 'We will come straight to the
      point'! Well, now you may come straight to the point. But do not forget,
      in blaming me, that you love another woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was petrified. Not a drop of blood remained in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true, this that you are telling me?&rdquo; he cried, dazed and shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not ask. Call upon your dreams for the answer, if you must have
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is some horrible, ghastly delusion. It cannot be true. Her name has
      not passed my lips in twenty years. It is not mentioned in my presence. I
      have not uttered that woman's name&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how should I know her name? Her own son does not know it, I firmly
      believe. No one appears to know it except the man who says he despises
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreams! Dreams!&rdquo; he cried scornfully. &ldquo;Shall I be held responsible for
      the unthinkable things that happen in dreams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied significantly; &ldquo;you should not be held accountable. She
      must be held accountable. You drove out her body, James, but not her
      spirit. It stands beside you every instant of the day and night. By day
      you do not see her; by night&mdash;ah, you tremble! Well, she is dead,
      they say. If she were still alive I myself might tremble, and with cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before God, I love you, Yvonne. I implore you to think nothing of my
      maunderings in sleep. They&mdash;they may come from a disordered brain.
      God knows there was a time when I felt that I was mad, raving mad. These
      dreams are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise she laid her hand gently on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity you sometimes, James. My heart aches for you. You are a man&mdash;a
      strong, brave man, and yet you shrink and cringe when a voice whispers to
      you in the night. You sleep with your doubts awake. Yes, yes, I believe
      you when you say that you love me. I am sure that you do; but let me tell
      you what it is that I have divined. It is Matilde that you are loving
      through me. When you kiss me there is in the back of your mind somewhere
      the thought of kisses that were given long ago. When you hold me close to
      you it is the body of Matilde that you feel, it is her breath that warms
      your cheeks. I am Matilde, not Yvonne, to you. I am the flesh on which
      that starved love of yours feeds; I represent the memory of all that you
      have lost; I am the bodily instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is&mdash;madness!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and it was not only wonder that
      filled his eyes. There was a strange fear in them, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not expect you to admit that all this is true, James,&rdquo; she went on
      patiently. &ldquo;You will confess one day that I am right, however; to
      yourself, if not to me. If the time should ever come when I give to you a
      child&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She shivered and turned her eyes away from
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid an unsteady hand upon the dark head. &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; he murmured
      brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be Matilde's child to you,&rdquo; she concluded, facing him again
      without so much as a quaver in her voice, she spoke calmly, as if the
      statement were the most commonplace remark in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven, Yvonne!&rdquo; he exclaimed, drawing back in utter dismay. &ldquo;You
      must compose yourself. This is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite myself, James,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;Can you deny that you think
      of her when you hold me in your arms? Can you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he almost shouted. &ldquo;I can and do deny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are lying to yourself, my husband,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fairly gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! What manner of woman are you?&rdquo; he cried hoarsely. &ldquo;A sorceress?
      A&mdash;but no, it is not true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;All women are sorceresses. They feel. Men only think. Poor
      Frederic! You try to hate him, James, but I have watched you when you were
      not aware. You search his face intently, almost in agony&mdash;for what?
      For the look that was his mother's&mdash;for the expression you loved in&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He burst out violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! By Heaven, you are wrong there! I am not looking for Matilde in
      Frederic's face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For his father, then?&rdquo; she inquired slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perspiration stood out on his brow. He made no response. His lips were
      compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have uttered her name at last,&rdquo; she said wonderingly, after a long
      wait for him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood started. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, this is torture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must mend our ways, James. It may please you to know that I shall
      overlook your mental faithlessness to me. You may go on loving Matilde.
      She is dead. I am alive. I have the better of her there, <i>aïe?</i> The
      day will come when she will be dead in every sense of the word. In the
      meantime, I am content to enjoy life. Frederic is quite safe with me,
      James; very much safer than he is with you. And now let us have peace.
      Will you ring for tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down abruptly, staring at her with heavy eyes. She waited for a
      moment and then crossed over to pull the old-fashioned bell-cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will ask Lydia and Frederic to join us, too,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It shall be a
      family party, the five of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five?&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, without a smile.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> fortnight passed.
      Yvonne held the destiny of three persons in her hand. They were like
      figures on a chess-board, and she moved them with the sureness, the
      unerring instinct of any skilled disciple of the philosopher's game. They
      were puppets; she ranged them about her stage in swift-changing pictures,
      and applauded her own effectiveness. There were no rehearsals. The play
      was going on all the time, whether tragedy, comedy, or chess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood's uneasiness increased. His moody eyes were seldom lifted to meet
      the question that he knew lurked in hers. She had given him a tremendous
      shock. There was seldom a moment in which he was not making strange
      inquiries of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that she had spoken the truth about him? Could such a
      condition of mind exist without his knowledge? Was this love he professed
      to feel for her but the flame springing into life from those despised
      embers of long ago? Was it true that his inner self, his subconscious
      being, recognised no other claim to his love than the one held so
      insecurely by its original possessor? Was it true that his soul went back
      to her the instant slumber came to close up the gap of years?
    </p>
    <p>
      This strange, new wife of his had uttered amazing words; she had spoken
      without rancour; she had called his dreams to life; she had told him how
      he lived while asleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      He arose in the mornings, haggard from lack of reposeful sleep. In a way,
      he slept with one ear open, constantly striving to catch himself with the
      dream-name on his lips. He would awake with a start many times in the
      night, and always there seemed to be the vague, ghostlike whisper of a
      name dying away in the stillness that greeted his return to wakefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he confessed to himself that his dreams were of Matilde, as they had
      been during all the years. Heretofore they had been mere impressions upon
      his intelligence, and seldom remembered. They did not represent pictures
      or incidents in which she appeared as a potent factor, but brief monodies,
      with her name as the single note, her face a passing, yet impressive,
      vision. He had not realised how frequent, how real these dreams were until
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sometimes lay perfectly still after these awakenings, wondering if
      Yvonne was listening at his closed door, straining his ears for the sound
      of a creaking board that would betray her presence as she stole back to
      her own bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What surprised and puzzled him most was her serenity in the face of these
      involuntary revelations. She did not appear to be disturbed by the fact
      that his dreams, his most secret thoughts, were of another woman. There
      was nothing in her manner to indicate that she suffered any of the pangs
      of jealousy, humiliation, dismay, or doubt that might reasonably have been
      expected under the circumstances. She seemed to put the matter entirely
      out of her mind as trivial, unimportant, unvexing. He found himself
      wondering what his own state of mind would be if the conditions were
      reversed and it was she who cried out in her sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic was alert, shifty, secretive. He knew himself to be the link in
      the chain that would offer the least resistance of any if it came to the
      question of endurance. He realised that the slightest tug at the chain
      would cause it to snap, and that the break would never be repaired. His
      stepmother for the present fortified the weak spot in the chain; but would
      her strength be sufficient to support the strain that was to be imposed
      upon both links in the end?
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her like a hawk, ever on the lookout for the slightest signs of
      commendation, reproof, warning, encouragement. She alone stood between him
      and what appeared to be the inevitable. The truce was a mask that hid none
      of the real features of the situation. When would it be discarded?
    </p>
    <p>
      After that illuminating hour in her boudoir he saw himself in a far from
      noble position. The situation was no longer indefinite. He had taken a
      step that could not be recalled. His loyalty to Lydia had been tested, and
      the sickening truth came out&mdash;he was a traitor! He knew in his soul
      that he loved the girl. His conscience told him so. But his conscience
      suddenly had become an elastic thing that stretched over a pretty wide
      scope of emotions. These he tried to analyse and, failing to do so with
      credit to himself, settled back into a state of apathy better described as
      sullen self-pity. He even went so far as to blame his father for the new
      blight that had been put upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the three, Lydia alone faced the situation with courage. She was young,
      she was good, she was inexperienced, but she saw what was going on beneath
      the surface with a clarity of vision that would have surprised an older
      and more practised person; and, seeing, was favoured with the strength to
      endure pain that otherwise would have been insupportable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that Frederic was infatuated. She did not try to hide the truth
      from herself. The boy she loved was slipping away from her, and only
      chance could set his feet back in the old path from which he blindly
      strayed. Her woman's heart told her that it was not love he felt for
      Yvonne. The strange mentor that guides her sex out of the ignorance of
      youth into an understanding of hitherto unpresented questions revealed to
      her the nature of his feeling for this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would come back to her in time, she knew, chastened; the same instinct
      that revealed his frailties to her also defended his sense of honour. The
      unthinkable could never happen!
    </p>
    <p>
      She judged Yvonne, too, in a spirit of fairness that was amazing,
      considering the lack of perspective that must have been hers to contend
      with. Despite a natural feeling of antagonism, present even before she saw
      the new wife of James Brood, and long before her influence affected
      Brood's son, Lydia found herself confronted by a curious faith in Yvonne's
      goodness of heart. It never entered the girl's mind to question the honour
      of this woman&mdash;no more than she would have questioned her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanity, love of admiration, the inherent fear of retrogression, greed for
      attention&mdash;any one of these might have been responsible for her
      conduct covering the past three months. There was certainly a reckless
      disregard for consequences on her part so far as others&mdash;notably
      Frederic&mdash;were concerned. She could not be blind to his plight, and
      yet it was her pleasure to drag him out beyond his depth where he might
      struggle or drown while she, sirenlike, looked on for the moment and then
      turned calmly to the more serious business of combing her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother saw the suffering in the girl's eyes, but saw also the proud
      spirit that would have resented sympathy from one even so close as she.
      Down in the heart of that quiet, reserved mother smouldered a hatred for
      Yvonne Brood that would have stopped at nothing had it been in her power
      to inflict punishment for the wrong that was being done. She, too, saw
      tragedy ahead, but her vision was broader than Lydia's. It included the
      figure of James Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia worked steadily, almost doggedly, at the task she had undertaken to
      complete for the elder Brood. Every afternoon found her seated at the desk
      in the study opposite the stern-faced man who laboured with her over the
      seemingly endless story of his life. Something told her that there were
      secret chapters which she was not to write. She wrote those that were to
      endure; the others were to die with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her as she wrote, and his eyes were often hard. He saw the
      growing haggardness in her gentle, girlish face; the wistful, puzzled
      expression in her dark eyes. A note of tenderness crept into his voice and
      remained there through all the hours they spent together. The old-time
      brusqueness disappeared from his speech; the sharp, authoritative tone was
      gone. He watched her with pity in his heart, for he knew it was ordained
      that one day he, too, was to hurt this loyal, pure-hearted creature even
      as the others were wounding her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frequently went out of his way to perform quaint little acts of
      courtesy and kindness that would have surprised him only a short time
      before. He sent theatre and opera tickets to Lydia and her mother. He
      placed bouquets of flowers at the girl's end of the desk, obviously for
      her alone. He sent her home&mdash;just around the corner&mdash;in the
      automobile on rainy or blizzardy days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he never allowed her an instant's rest when it came to the work in
      hand, and therein lay the gentle shrewdness of the man. She was better off
      busy. There were times when he studied the face of Lydia's mother for
      signs that might show how her thoughts ran in relation to the conditions
      that were confronting all of them. But more often he searched the features
      of the boy who called him father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of them knew that there were solemn hours in all the days when
      Yvonne sat shivering in her room and stared, dry-eyed and bleak, at the
      walls which surrounded her, seeing not them, but something far beyond.
      Often she sat before her long cheval-glass, either with lowering eyes or
      in a sort of wistful wonder, never removing her steady gaze from the face
      reflected there. There were other times when she stood before the striking
      photograph of her husband on the dressing-table, studying the face through
      narrowed lids, as if she searched for something that baffled, yet
      impressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always, always there was music in the house. Behind the closed doors of
      his distant study James Brood listened in spite of himself to the
      persistent thrumming of the piano downstairs. Always were the airs light
      and seductive; the dreamy, plaintive compositions of Strauss, Ziehrer, and
      others of their kind and place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic, with uncanny fidelity to the preferences of the mother he had
      never seen, but whose influence directed him, affected the same general
      class of music that had appealed to her moods and temperament. Times there
      were, and often, when he played the very airs that she had loved, and
      then, despite his profound antipathy, James Brood's thoughts leaped back a
      quarter of a century and fixed themselves on love-scenes and love-times
      that would not be denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again there were the wild, riotous airs that she had played with
      Feverelli, her soft-eyed music-master! Accursed airs&mdash;accursed and
      accusing!
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave orders that these airs were not to be played, but failed to make
      his command convincing for the reason that he could not bring himself to
      the point of explaining why they were distasteful to him. When Frederic
      thoughtlessly whistled or hummed fragments of those proscribed airs he
      considered himself justified in commanding him to stop on the pretext that
      they were disturbing, but he could not use the same excuse for checking
      the song on the lips of his gay and impulsive wife. Sometimes he wondered
      why she persisted when she knew that he was annoyed. Her airy little
      apologies for her forgetfulness were of no consequence, for within the
      hour her memory was almost sure to be at fault again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Dawes fell ill. He ventured out one day when the winds of March were
      fierce and sharp, and, being an adventurer, caught the most dangerous sort
      of a cold. He came in shivering and considerably annoyed because Jones or
      Ranjab or some other incompetent servant had failed to advise him to wear
      an overcoat and galoshes. To his surprise Mrs Brood ordered a huge, hot
      drink of whisky and commanded him to drink it&mdash;&ldquo;like a good boy.&rdquo; Then she
      had him stowed away in bed with loads of blankets about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before dinner she came up to see him. He was still shivering. So was
      Mr Riggs, for that matter, but Mr Riggs failed to shiver convincingly and
      did not receive the treatment he desired. Their unexpected visitor felt
      the pulse and forehead of the sick man, uttered a husky little cry of
      dismay, and announced that he had a fever. Whereupon Mr Dawes said, rather
      shamefacedly, that he would be all right in the morning and that it was
      nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have the doctor at once, Mr Dawes,&rdquo; said she, and instructed Mr
      Riggs to call Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want a doctor,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you don't,&rdquo; said she, with her rarest smile; &ldquo;but I <i>do</i>, you
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're no good,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better have one,&rdquo; advised Mr Riggs with sudden solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never had one in my life,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes. &ldquo;Don't believe in 'em. I'll
      take a couple of stiff drinks before I go to bed and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you've gone to bed, you old dear,&rdquo; cried she, stroking his burning
      hand gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too astonished to say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jumping Jees&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr Riggs, completely staggered. &ldquo;I
      mean, what doctor, Mrs Brood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jones will know. Now, Mr Dawes, you must do just as I tell you to do. You
      are nothing but a child, you know. If&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Joe!&rdquo; called out the sick man desperately, but his comrade was gone.
      &ldquo;Don't let him call a&mdash;doctor, Mrs Brood; please don't!&rdquo; he implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the edge of the bed, holding his hand between her soft,
      cool palms, and smiled at him so tenderly that he stared for a moment in
      utter bewilderment and then gulped mightily. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't want to be sick here, bothering you and upsetting
      everything&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he blubbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have you up and about in a day or two,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's such an infernal nuisance. You oughtn't to be sitting here,
      either. It may be catching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I'm not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;it's mighty good of you,&rdquo; he muttered, his eyes blinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are friends for, Mr Dawes, if they can't be depended upon in times
      of sickness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Am I not your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;well, by gosh!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;I&mdash;I must tell this to
      Joe. He'll&mdash;I beg your pardon, I guess I'm a little flighty. Maybe
      I'm worse than I think. Delirious or something like that. Say, you don't
      think it's&mdash;it's serious, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. A heavy cold, that's all. The doctor will break it up
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it's the grippe, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's my temperature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't worry, Mr Dawes. It's all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment, steadfastly regarding the hand that stroked
      his wrinkled old paw so gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;if it should turn out to be pneumonia or lung fever, I wish you
      wouldn't let on to Joe,&rdquo; said he anxiously. &ldquo;It would worry him almost to
      death. He's not very strong, you see. Nothing like me. I'm as strong as a
      bull. Never been sick in my&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;He isn't half so strong as you, Mr Dawes. You
      are so strong you will be able to throw off this cold in a jiffy, as Jones
      would say. It won't amount to anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I get much worse you'd better send me to a hospital. Awful nuisance
      having a sick man about the place. Spoils everything. Don't hesitate about
      sending me off, Mrs Brood. I wouldn't be a trouble to you or Jim for&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor old dear! You shall stay right where you are, no matter what
      comes to pass, and I shall take charge of you myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; She nodded her head briskly. &ldquo;Well, by jiggers, I&mdash;I don't
      know what Joe'll say when I tell him this. Blast him; I'll bet my head he
      calls me a liar. If he does, blast him, I'll&mdash;oh, I beg your pardon! I
      don't seem to be able to get over the habit of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is Mr Riggs&mdash;and my husband,&rdquo; she interrupted, as the door
      opened and the two men strode into the room. &ldquo;Is Jones telephoning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Brood. &ldquo;Why, what's gone wrong, old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all my fault,&rdquo; groaned Mr Riggs, sitting down heavily on the
      opposite side of the bed. &ldquo;I let him go out without his overcoat. He's not
      a strong man, Jim. Least breath of air goes right through&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Riggs, you know better than that,&rdquo; roared the sick man
      wrathfully. &ldquo;I can stand more&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; cried Mrs Brood reprovingly. &ldquo;It isn't fair to quarrel
      with Mr Riggs. He can't very well abuse you in return, Mr Dawes, can he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be on your death-bed,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs mournfully, as if that were
      reason enough for not abusing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Brood; but it was an anxious look that he shot at Yvonne.
      Mr Dawes's face was fiery hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall come back to see you immediately after dinner, Mr Dawes,&rdquo; said
      she, and again stroked his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two old men stared after her rather blankly as she left the room. They
      couldn't believe their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says she'll look after me herself,&rdquo; murmured Mr Dawes hazily. Mr
      Riggs tucked the covers about his chin. &ldquo;Don't do that, Joe! Leave things
      alone, darn you. She fixed 'em as they ought to be.&rdquo; Mr Riggs obediently
      undid his work. &ldquo;That's right. Now don't you do anything without askin'
      her, d'ye hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only trying to make you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't do it. Leave everything to her.&rdquo; The upshot of it all was
      that Mr Dawes came near to dying. Pneumonia set in at once, and for many
      days he fought what appeared to be a losing fight. Then came the splendid
      days of convalescence, the happiest days of his life. The amazing Mrs
      Brood did &ldquo;look after him.&rdquo; Nurses there were, of course, and doctors in
      consultation, but it was the much-berated mistress of the house who
      &ldquo;pulled him through,&rdquo; as he afterward and always declared in acrimonious
      disputes with Mr Riggs who, while secretly blessing the wife of Brood,
      could not be driven into an open admission that she had done &ldquo;anything
      more than anybody else would have done under the circumstances,&rdquo;&mdash;and
      not &ldquo;half as much, for that matter, as he could have done had he been
      given a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be well to observe here that Mr Riggs was of no earthly use
      whatever during the trying days. Indeed, he gave up hope the instant the
      doctor said &ldquo;pneumonia,&rdquo; and went about the house saying &ldquo;My God&rdquo; to
      himself and everybody else in sepulchral whispers, all the while urging
      Heaven to &ldquo;please do something.&rdquo; He was too pathetic for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new and totally unsuspected element in Yvonne's make-up came to light at
      this troublous period. She forsook many pleasures, many comforts in her
      eagerness to help the suffering old man who, she must have known, in his
      heart had long despised her. She did not interfere with the nurses, yet
      made herself so indispensable to old Mr Dawes in the capacity of &ldquo;visiting
      angel&rdquo; that his heart overflowed with gratitude and love. Even when death
      hung directly above his almost sightless eyes he saw her smile of
      encouragement in the shadows, and his spirit responded with what might
      justly have been called the battle-cry of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Brood this new side to Yvonne's far from understandable character was
      most gratifying. Seeing her in the rôle of good Samaritan was not so
      surprising to him as the real, unaffected sincerity with which she
      ministered to the wants of the querulous old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the nurses, habitually opposed to the good offices of &ldquo;the family,&rdquo;
       were won over by this woman whose unparalleled sweetness levelled them
      into a condition of respect and love that surprised not only themselves
      but the doctors. They were quite docile from the start, and seldom, if
      ever, spoke of Mr Dawes as &ldquo;the patient&rdquo; or of his state as &ldquo;the case.&rdquo;
       They got into the habit of alluding to him as the &ldquo;dear old man,&rdquo; and
      somehow envied each other the hours &ldquo;on duty.&rdquo; They were never sour.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, when it came time for Mr Dawes to thank the Lord for his escape,
      he refused to commit himself to anything so ridiculous! He even went so
      far as to declare that the doctor had nothing to do with it, a statement
      which rather staggered the nurses.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours Yvonne read to the blissful old chap. Sometimes she read to him
      in French, again in Russian, and occasionally in German. It was all one to
      him. He did not understand a word of it, but he was happy. He felt
      surprisingly young.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave up a month to him and he was prepared to give up his life to her.
      To his utter amazement, however, she did not exact anything so valuable as
      that. Indeed, when his recovery was quite complete, she calmly forgot his
      existence and he sank back into the oblivion from which calamity had
      dragged him; sank back to the unhappy level of Mr Riggs and all the others
      who failed to interest her; and there he dreamed of exalted days when she
      wanted him to live, contrasting them with these days in which he might
      just as well be dead for all she seemed to care! He was one of the &ldquo;old
      men&rdquo; again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Riggs, writhing with jealousy, repeatedly remarked, &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo;
       and somehow felt revenged for the insolent orders she had given to Jones,
      depriving him of the right to even approach the door of the room in which
      his lifelong friend was dying. It had been a hard week for Mr Riggs. He
      hated her as he had never hated anyone in his life before. And yet he
      thanked God for her, and would have died for her! Nothing, nothing in the
      world would have given him more pleasure than to be critically ill for
      her!

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything wrong with my hair, Mr Brood?&rdquo; asked Lydia, with a
      nervous little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in the study, and it was ten o'clock of a wet night in April. Of
      late he had required her to spend the evenings with him in a strenuous
      effort to complete the final chapters of the journal. The illness of Mr
      Dawes had interrupted the work, and he was now in a fever of impatience to
      make up for the lost time. He had declared his intention to go abroad with
      his wife as soon as the manuscript was completed. The editor of a
      magazine, a personal friend, had signified his willingness to edit the
      journal and to put it into shape for publication during the summer months,
      against Brood's return in the fall of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the house spared neither himself nor Lydia in these last few
      weeks. He wanted to clear up everything before he went away. Lydia's
      willingness to devote the extra hours to his enterprise would have pleased
      him vastly if he had not been afflicted by the same sense of unrest and
      uneasiness that made incessant labour a boon to her as well as to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her query followed a long period of silence on his part. He had been
      suggesting alterations in her notes as she read them to him, and there
      were frequent lulls when she made the changes as directed. Without looking
      at him she felt, rather than knew, that he was regarding her fixedly from
      his position opposite. The scrutiny was disturbing to her. She hazarded
      the question for want of a better means of breaking the spell. Of late he
      had taken to watching her with moody interest. She knew that he was
      mentally commenting on the changes he could not help observing in her
      appearance and her manners. This intense, though perhaps unconscious,
      scrutiny annoyed her. Her face was flushed with embarrassment, her heart
      was beating with undue rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood started guiltily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hair?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, I see. You women always feel that
      something is wrong with it. I was thinking of something else, however.
      Forgive my stupidity. We can't afford to waste time in thinking, you know,
      and I am a pretty bad offender. It's nearly half-past ten. We've been hard
      at it since eight o'clock. Time to knock off. I will walk around to your
      apartment with you, my dear. It looks like an all-night rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up to the window and pulled the curtains aside. Her eyes followed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's such a short distance, Mr Brood,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am not afraid to go
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was staring down into the court, his fingers grasping the curtains in a
      rigid grip. He did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a light in the windows opening out upon Yvonne's balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy Frederic has come in from the concert,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;He will
      take you home, Lydia. You'd like that better, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned toward her, and she paused in the nervous collecting of her
      papers. His eyes were as hard as steel, his lips were set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't ask Frederic to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have left early,&rdquo; he muttered, glancing at his watch. Returning
      to the table he struck the big, melodious gong a couple of sharp blows.
      For the first time in her recollection it sounded a jangling, discordant
      note, as of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt her heart sink; an oppressing sense of alarm came over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Mr Brood. Don't think of coming home with&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Frederic will go with you.&rdquo; It was a command. Ranjab appeared in
      the doorway. &ldquo;Have Mrs Brood and Mr Frederic returned, Ranjab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>sahib</i>. At ten o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr Frederic is in his room, send him to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not in his room, <i>sahib</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two, master and man, looked at each other steadily for a moment.
      Something passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him that Miss Desmond is ready to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>sahib</i>.&rdquo; The curtains fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to go home alone, Mr Brood,&rdquo; said Lydia, her eyes flashing. &ldquo;Why
      did you send&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; he demanded harshly. She winced, and he was at once sorry.
      &ldquo;Forgive me. I am tired and&mdash;a bit nervous. And you, too, are tired.
      You've been working too steadily at this miserable job, my dear child.
      Thank Heaven, it will soon be over. Pray sit down. Frederic will soon be
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not tired,&rdquo; she protested stubbornly. &ldquo;I love the work. You don't
      know how proud I shall be when it comes out, and&mdash;and I realise that
      I helped in its making. No one has ever been in a position to tell the
      story of Tibet as you have told it, Mr Brood. Those chapters will make
      history. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your poor father's share in those explorations is what really makes the
      work valuable, my dear. Without his notes and letters I should have been
      feeble indeed.&rdquo; He looked at his watch. &ldquo;They were at the concert, you
      know&mdash;the Hungarian orchestra. A recent importation, 'Tzigane's'
      music. Gipsies.&rdquo; His sentences as well as his thoughts were staccato,
      disconnected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia turned very cold. She dreaded the scene that now seemed unavoidable.
      Frederic would come in response to his father's command, and then&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone began to play upon the piano downstairs. She knew, and he knew,
      that it was Frederic who played. For a long time they listened. The air,
      no doubt, was one he had heard during the evening, a soft, sensuous waltz
      that she had never heard before. The girl's eyes were upon Brood's face.
      It was like a graven image.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; fell from his stiff lips. Suddenly he turned upon the girl. &ldquo;Do you
      know what he is playing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, scarcely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was played in this house by its composer before Frederic was born. It
      was played here on the night of his birth, as it had been played many
      times before. It was written by a man named Feverelli. Have you heard of
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she murmured, and shrank, frightened by the deathlike pallor in
      the man's face, by the strange calm in his voice. The gates were being
      opened at last! She saw the thing that was to stalk forth. She would have
      closed her ears against the revelations it carried. &ldquo;Mother will be
      worried if I am not at home&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guido Feverelli. An Italian born in Hungary. Budapest, that was his home,
      but he professed to be a gipsy. Yes, he wrote the devilish thing. He
      played it a thousand times in that room down&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; And now
      Frederic plays it, after all these years. It is his heritage. God, how I
      hate the thing! Ranjab! Where is the fellow? He must stop the accursed
      thing. He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Brood! Mr Brood!&rdquo; cried Lydia, appalled. She began to edge toward the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a mighty effort Brood regained control of himself. He sank into a
      chair, motioning for her to remain. The music had ceased abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be here in a moment,&rdquo; said Brood. &ldquo;Don't go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waited, listening. Ranjab entered the room; so noiseless was his
      approach that neither heard his footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Brood, looking beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Frederic begs a few minutes' time, <i>sahib</i>. He is putting
      down on paper the music, so that he may not forget. He writes the notes,
      <i>sahib. Madame</i> assists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood's shoulders sagged. His head was bent, but his gaze never left the
      face of the Hindu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go, Ranjab,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes he asks for, <i>sahib</i>, that is all.&rdquo; The curtains fell
      behind him once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that he may not forget!&rdquo; fell from Brood's lips. He was looking at the
      girl, but did not address his words to her. &ldquo;So that he may not forget! So
      that I, too, may not forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he arose and confronted the serene image of the Buddha. For a
      full minute he stood there with his hands clasped, his lips moving as if
      in prayer. No sound came from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl remained transfixed, powerless to move. Not until he turned
      toward her and spoke was the spell broken. Then she came quickly to his
      side. He had pronounced her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are about to tell me something, Mr Brood,&rdquo; she cried in great
      agitation. &ldquo;I do not care to listen. I feel that it is something I should
      not know. Please let me go now. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hands upon her shoulders, holding her off at arm's length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very fond of you, Lydia. I do not want to hurt you. Sooner would I
      have my tongue cut out than it should wound you by a single word. Yet I
      must speak. You love Frederic. Is not that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned his gaze unwaveringly. Her face was very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr Brood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known it for some time, although I was the last to see. You love
      him, and you are just beginning to realise that he is not worthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Brood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eyes have been opened.&rdquo; She stared, speechless. &ldquo;My poor girl, he
      was born to prove that honest love is the rarest thing in all this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg of you, Mr Brood, don't&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better that we should talk it over. We have ten minutes. No doubt
      he has told you that he loves you. He is a lovable boy, he is the kind one
      <i>must</i> love. But it is not in his power to love nobly. He loves
      lightly as&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated, and then went on harshly&mdash;&ldquo;as his
      father before him loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anger dulled her understanding; she did not grasp the full meaning of his
      declaration. Her honest heart rose to the defence of Frederic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Brood, I do care for Frederic,&rdquo; she flamed, standing very erect before
      him. &ldquo;He is not himself, he has not been himself since she came here. Oh,
      I am fully aware of what I am saying. He is not to be blamed for this
      thing that has happened to him. No one is to blame. It had to be. I can
      wait, Mr Brood. Frederic loves me. I know he does. He will come back to
      me. You have no right to say that he loves lightly, ignobly. You do not
      know him as I know him. You have never tried to know him, never wanted to
      know him. You&mdash;oh, I beg your pardon, Mr Brood. I&mdash;I am
      forgetting myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you do not understand yourself, Lydia,&rdquo; said he levelly. &ldquo;You
      are young, you are trusting. Your lesson will cost you a great deal, my
      dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken. I do understand myself,&rdquo; she said gravely. &ldquo;May I speak
      plainly, Mr Brood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I intend to speak plainly to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic loves me. He does not love Yvonne. He is fascinated, as I also
      am fascinated by her, and you, too, Mr Brood. The spell has fallen over
      all of us. Let me go on, please. You say that Frederic loves like his
      father before him. That is true. He loves but one woman. You love but one
      woman, and she is dead. You will always love her. Frederic is like you. He
      loves Yvonne as you do&mdash;oh, I know it hurts! She cast her spell over you,
      why not over him? Is he stronger than you? Is it strange that she should
      attract him as she attracted you? You glory in her beauty, her charm, her
      perfect loveliness, and yet you love&mdash;yes, <i>love</i>, Mr Brood&mdash;the
      woman who was Frederic's mother. Do I make my meaning plain? Well, so it
      is that Frederic loves me. I am content to wait. I know he loves me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all this Brood stared at her in sheer astonishment. He had no
      feeling of anger, no resentment, no thought of protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you astound me, Lydia. Is this your own impression, or has it
      been suggested to you by&mdash;by another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only agreeing with you when you say that he loves as his father
      loved before him&mdash;but not lightly. Ah, not lightly, Mr Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you are saying,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I do,&rdquo; she cried earnestly. &ldquo;You invite my opinion; I trust you
      will accept it for what it is worth. Before you utter another word against
      Frederic, let me remind you that I have known both of you for a long, long
      time. In all the years I have been in this house I have never known you to
      grant him a tender, loving word. My heart has ached for him. There have
      been times when I almost hated you. He feels your neglect, your harshness,
      your&mdash;your cruelty. He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruelty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing less. You do not like him. I cannot understand why you
      should treat him as you do. He shrinks from you. Is it right, Mr Brood,
      that a son should shrink from his father as a dog cringes at the voice of
      an unkind master? I might be able to understand your attitude toward him
      if your unkindness was of recent origin, but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recent origin?&rdquo; he demanded quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had begun with the advent of Mrs Brood,&rdquo; she explained frankly,
      undismayed by his scowl. &ldquo;I do not understand all that has gone before. Is
      it surprising, Mr Brood, that your son finds it difficult to love you? Do
      you deserve&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood stopped her with a gesture of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time has come for frankness on my part. You set me an example, Lydia.
      You have the courage of your father. For months I have had it in my mind
      to tell you the truth about Frederic, but my courage has always failed me.
      Perhaps I use the wrong word. It may be something very unlike cowardice
      that has held me back. I am going to put a direct question to you first of
      all, and I ask you to answer truthfully. Would you say that Frederic is
      like&mdash;that is, resembles his father?&rdquo; He was leaning forward, his
      manner intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an odd thing to say! Of course he resembles his father. I have never
      seen a portrait of his mother, but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that he looks like me?&rdquo; demanded Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood laughed, a short, ugly laugh&mdash;and then fingered his chin
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He resembles his mother,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he is angry he is very much like you, Mr Brood. I have often
      wondered why he is unlike you at other times. Now I know. He is like his
      mother. She must have been lovely, gentle, patient&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Suppose I were to tell you that Frederic is not my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not believe you, Mr Brood,&rdquo; she replied flatly. &ldquo;What is it that
      you are trying to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go on with it. The subject is closed. There is nothing to tell&mdash;at
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She placed herself in front of him, resolute and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist, Mr Brood. The time <i>has</i> come for you to be frank. You
      must tell me what you meant by that remark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your mother never told you anything concerning my past life?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has my mother to do with your past life?&rdquo; she inquired, suddenly
      afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refer only to what she may have heard from your father. He knew more
      than any of them. I confided in him to a great extent. I had to unburden
      myself to someone. He was my best friend. It is not improbable that he
      repeated certain parts of my story to your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has told me that you&mdash;you were not happy, Mr Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a little girl I heard my father say to her that your life had
      been ruined by&mdash;well, that your marriage had turned out badly,&rdquo; she
      confessed haltingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said&mdash;I remember feeling terribly about it&mdash;he said you had
      driven your wife out of this very house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he speak of another man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Her music-master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were too young to know what that meant, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that you never saw her after&mdash;after she left this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you understand how horrible it all was if I say to you now that&mdash;Frederic
      is not my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes filled with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say such a thing, Mr Brood? He is your son. How can you say&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father is the man who wrote the accursed waltz he has just been
      playing! Could there be anything more devilish than the conviction it
      carries? After all these years, he&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Mr Brood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry if I hurt you, Lydia. You have asked me why I hate him. Need I
      say anything more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only made me love him more than ever before. You cannot hurt me
      through Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry that it has come to such a pass as this. It is not right that
      you should be made to suffer, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe all that you have told me. He <i>is</i> your son. He <i>is</i>,
      Mr Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would to God I could believe that!&rdquo; he cried in a voice of agony. &ldquo;I
      would to God it were true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could believe it if you chose to believe your own eyes, your own
      heart.&rdquo; She lowered her voice to a half whisper. &ldquo;Does&mdash;does Frederic
      know? Does he know that his mother&mdash;oh, I can't believe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you did drive her out of this house?&rdquo; Brood did not answer. &ldquo;You sent
      her away and and kept her boy, the boy who was nothing to you? Nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kept him,&rdquo; he said, with a queer smile on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these years? He never knew his mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never heard her name spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know that she is dead. She never saw him after&mdash;after that
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Mr Brood, may I ask why you have always intended to tell me this
      dreadful thing?&rdquo; she demanded, her eyes gleaming with a fierce, accusing
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared. &ldquo;Doesn't&mdash;doesn't it put a different light on your
      estimate of him? Doesn't it convince you that he is not worthy of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! A thousand times no!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I love him. If he were to ask me to
      be his wife tonight I would rejoice&mdash;oh, I would rejoice! Someone is
      coming. Let me say this to you, Mr Brood: you have brought Frederic up as
      a butcher fattens the calves and swine he prepares for slaughter. You are
      waiting for the hour to come when you can kill his very soul with the
      weapon you have held over him for so long, waiting, waiting, waiting! In
      God's name, what has <i>he</i> done that you should want to strike him
      down after all these years? It is in my heart to curse you, but somehow I
      feel that you are a curse to yourself. I will not say that I cannot
      understand how you feel about everything. You have suffered. I know you
      have, and I&mdash;I am sorry for you. And knowing how bitter life has been
      for you, I implore you to be merciful to him who is innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man listened without the slightest change of expression. The lines
      seemed deeper about his eyes, that was all. But the eyes were bright and
      as hard as the steel they resembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowing that he is a scoundrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you say that, Mr Brood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he levelly, &ldquo;he <i>thinks</i> he is my son.&rdquo; Voices were
      heard on the stairs, Frederic's and Yvonne's. &ldquo;He is coming now, my dear,&rdquo;
       he went on, and then, after a pause fraught with significance, &ldquo;and my
      wife is with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia closed her eyes, as if in dire pain. A dry sob was in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange thing happened to Brood, the man of iron. Tears suddenly rushed
      to his eyes.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>vonne stopped in
      the doorway. Ranjab was holding the curtains aside for her to enter. The
      tall figure of Frederic loomed up behind her, his dark face glowing in the
      warm light that came from the room. She had changed her dress for an
      exquisite orchid-coloured tea-gown of chiffon under the rarest and most
      delicate of lace. For an instant her gaze rested on Lydia, and then went
      questioningly to Brood's face. The girl's confusion had not escaped her
      notice. Her husband's manner was but little less convicting. Her eyes
      narrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ranjab said you were expecting us,&rdquo; she said slowly, with marked emphasis
      on the participle. She came forward haltingly, as if in doubt as to her
      welcome. &ldquo;Are we interrupting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Brood, a flush of annoyance on his cheek. &ldquo;Lydia is
      tired. I sent Ranjab down to ask Frederic to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frederic interrupted, a trifle too eagerly. &ldquo;I'll walk around with you,
      Lydia. It's raining, however. Shall I get the car out, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Lydia, painfully conscious of the rather awkward
      situation. &ldquo;And please don't bother, Freddy. I can go home alone. It's
      only a step.&rdquo; She moved toward the door, eager to be away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go with you,&rdquo; said Frederic decisively. He stood between her and the
      door, an embarrassed smile on his lips. &ldquo;I've got something to say to you,
      Lydia,&rdquo; he went on, lowering his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James dear,&rdquo; said Mrs Brood, shaking her finger at her husband, and with
      an exasperating smile on her lips, &ldquo;you are working the poor girl too
      hard. See how late it is! And how nervous she is. Why, you are trembling,
      Lydia! For shame, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a little tired,&rdquo; stammered Lydia. &ldquo;We are working so hard, you know,
      in order to finish the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood interrupted, his tone sharp and incisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end is in sight. We're a bit feverish over it, I suppose. You see, my
      dear, we have just escaped captivity in Thassa. It was a bit thrilling, I
      fancy. But we've stopped for the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I perceive,&rdquo; said Yvonne, a touch of insolence in her voice. &ldquo;You
      stopped, I dare say, when you heard the tread of the vulgar world
      approaching the inner temple. That is what you broke into and desecrated,
      wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inner temple at Thassa,&rdquo; he said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. The place you were escaping from when we came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clear to all of them that Yvonne was piqued, even angry. She
      deliberately crossed the room and threw herself upon the couch, an act so
      childish, so disdainful, that for a full minute no one spoke, but stared
      at her, each with a different emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia's eyes were flashing. Her lips parted, but she withheld the angry
      words that rose to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood's expression changed slowly from dull anger to one of incredulity,
      which swiftly gave way to positive joy. His wife was jealous!
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic was biting his lips nervously. He allowed Lydia to pass him on
      her way out, scarcely noticing her, so intently was his gaze fixed upon
      Yvonne. When Brood followed Lydia into the hall to remonstrate, the young
      man sprang eagerly to his stepmother's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, Yvonne!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;that was a nasty thing to say. What
      will Lydia think? By gad, is it possible that you are jealous? Of Lydia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealous?&rdquo; cried she, struggling with her fury. &ldquo;Jealous of that girl?
      Poof! Why should I be jealous of her? She hasn't the blood of a potato!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand you,&rdquo; he said in great perplexity. &ldquo;You&mdash;you told
      me to-night that you are not sure that you really love him. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him with a quick gesture. Her eyes were smouldering. &ldquo;Where is
      he? Gone away with her? Go and look; do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're in the hall. I shall take her home, never fear. I fancy he's
      trying to explain your insinuating&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned on him furiously. &ldquo;Are you lecturing me? What a tempest in a
      teapot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lydia's as good as gold. She&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take her home at once,&rdquo; sneered Yvonne. &ldquo;This is no place for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frederic paled. &ldquo;You're not trying to say my father would&mdash;good Lord,
      Yvonne, you must be crazy! Why, that is impossible! If&mdash;if I thought&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He clenched his fists and glared over his shoulder, missing the queer
      little smile that flitted across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do love her then,&rdquo; she said, her voice suddenly soft and caressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her in complete bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;Lord, you gave me a shock!&rdquo; He passed his hand across his
      moist forehead. &ldquo;It can't be so. Why, the very thought of it&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shall have to apologise to Lydia,&rdquo; said she calmly. &ldquo;Your
      father will exact it of me, and I shall obey. How does it sound, coming
      from me? 'I am sorry, Lydia.' Do I say it prettily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you at all, Yvonne. I adore you, and yet, by Heaven, I&mdash;I
      actually believe I hated you just now. Listen to me. I've been treating
      Lydia vilely for a long, long time, but&mdash;she's the finest, best,
      dearest girl in the world. You&mdash;even you, Yvonne&mdash;shall not
      utter a word against&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Aïe!</i> What heroics!&rdquo; she cried ironically.
      &ldquo;You are splendid when you are angry, my son. Yes, you are almost as
      splendid as your father. He, too, has been angry with me. He, too, has
      made me shudder. But he, too, has forgiven me, as you shall this instant.
      Say it, Freddy. You do forgive me? I was mean, nasty, ugly, vile&mdash;oh,
      everything that's horrid. I take it all back. Now be nice to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand on his arm, an appealing little caress that conquered
      him in a flash. He clasped her fingers fiercely in his and mumbled
      incoherently as he leaned forward, drawn resistlessly nearer by the
      strange magic that was hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you are wonderful,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I knew you'd regret what you
      said. You couldn't have meant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, patted his hand gently, and allowed her swimming eyes to rest
      on his for an instant to complete the conquest. Then she motioned him
      away. Brood's voice was heard in the doorway. She had, however, planted an
      insidious thing in Frederic's mind, and it would grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband re-entered the room, his arm linked in Lydia's. Frederic was
      at the table lighting a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not mean all that you said a moment ago, Yvonne,&rdquo; said Brood
      levelly. &ldquo;Lydia misinterpreted your jest. You meant nothing unkind, I am
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking straight into her rebellious eyes. The last gleam of
      defiance died out of them as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Lydia darling,&rdquo; she said, and reached out her hand to the
      girl who approached reluctantly, uncertainly. &ldquo;I confess that I was
      jealous. Why shouldn't I be jealous? You are so beautiful, so splendid.&rdquo;
       She drew the girl down beside her. &ldquo;Forgive me, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia, whose honest heart had been so full of resentment the moment
      before, could not withstand the humble appeal in the voice of the
      penitent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, first at Yvonne, then at Brood, and never quite understood the
      impulse that ordered her to kiss the warm, red lips that so recently had
      offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James dear,&rdquo; fell softly, alluringly, from Yvonne's now tremulous lips.
      He sprang to her side. She kissed him passionately. &ldquo;Now we are all
      ourselves once more,&rdquo; she gasped a moment later, her eyes still fixed
      inquiringly on those of the man beside her. &ldquo;Let us be gay! Let us forget!
      Come, Frederic! Sit here at my feet. Lydia is not going home yet. Ranjab,
      the cigarettes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frederic, white-faced and scowling, remained at the window, glaring out
      into the rain-swept night. A steady sheet of raindrops thrashed against
      the window-panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear the wind!&rdquo; cried Yvonne, after a single sharp glance at his tall,
      motionless figure. &ldquo;One can almost imagine that ghosts from every
      graveyard in the world are whistling past our windows. Should we not
      rejoice? We have them safely locked outside. There are no ghosts in
      here to make us shiver&mdash;and&mdash;shake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence that began so glibly trailed off in a slow crescendo, ending
      abruptly. Ranjab was holding the lighted taper for her cigarette. As she
      spoke her eyes were lifted to his dark, saturnine face. She was saying
      there were no ghosts when his eyes suddenly fastened on hers. In spite of
      herself her voice rose in response to the curious dread that chilled her
      heart as she looked into the shining mirrors above her. She shivered as if
      in the presence of death! For an incalculably brief period their gaze
      remained fixed and steady, each reading a mystery. Then the Hindu lowered
      his heavy lashes and moved away. The little by-scene did not go unnoticed
      by the others, although its meaning was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to be afraid of, Yvonne,&rdquo; said Brood, pressing the hand
      which trembled in his.
      &ldquo;Your imagination carries you a long way. Are you really afraid of
      ghosts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered in a deep, solemn voice that carried conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in ghosts. I believe the dead come back to us, not to flit
      about as we are told by superstition, but to lodge&mdash;actually to dwell&mdash;inside
      these warm, living bodies of ours. They come and go at will. Sometimes we
      feel that they are there, but&mdash;oh, who knows? Their souls may conquer ours
      and go on inhabiting&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried her husband. &ldquo;Once dead, always dead, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really believe that, James?&rdquo; she demanded seriously. &ldquo;Have you
      never felt that something that was not you was living, breathing, speaking
      in this earthly shell of yours? Something that was not you, I say.
      Something that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he exclaimed quickly, but his eyes were full of the wonder that
      he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic,&rdquo; she called imperatively, &ldquo;come away from that window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man joined the group. The sullen look in his face had given way
      to one of acute inquiry. The new note in her voice produced a strange
      effect upon him. It seemed like a call for help, a cry out of the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is raining pitchforks,&rdquo; he said, as if to explain his failure to
      respond at the first call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; sighed Lydia uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't go out in the storm, my dear,&rdquo; cried Yvonne, tightening her
      grip on the girl's arm. &ldquo;Draw up a chair, Freddy. Let's be cosy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mrs Brood, I should go at once. Mother&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother is in bed and asleep,&rdquo; protested Yvonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should all be in bed,&rdquo; said Frederic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bed is a sepulchre. We bury half our lives in it, Frederic. We spend
      too much time in bed. Why live in our dreams when we should be enjoying
      to-day and not our yesterdays? Do you want to hear about the concert,
      James? It was wonderful. The&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was so wonderful, why did you leave before it was over?&rdquo; demanded
      her husband, his lips straightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that we left before it was over?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been at home since ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all playing for time. They all realised that something sinister
      was attending their little conclave, unseen but vital. Each one knew that
      united they were safe, each against the other! Lydia was afraid because
      of Brood's revelations. Yvonne had sensed peril with the message delivered
      by Ranjab to Frederic. Frederic had come upstairs prepared for rebellion
      against the caustic remarks that were almost certain to come from his
      father. Brood was afraid of&mdash;himself! He was holding himself in check
      with the greatest difficulty. He knew that the smallest spark would create
      the explosion he dreaded and yet courted. Restraint lay heavily, yet
      shiftingly, upon all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Yvonne easily, &ldquo;there were still two numbers to be played, and
      I loathe both of them. Frederic was ready to come away, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dr Hodder? Did he come away with you?&rdquo; inquired Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He insisted on staying to the bitter end. We left him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood laughed shortly. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he would come down with the Gunnings,&rdquo; explained Yvonne, her eyes
      flickering. &ldquo;Besides, I always feel as though I were riding in an
      ambulance when he is in the car. He dissected every bit of music they
      played to-night. Now, James dear, you know he is quite dreadful.&rdquo; She said
      it pleadingly, poutingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offered to send the car back for him,&rdquo; said Frederic, speaking for the
      first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood drew a long breath. His glance met Lydia's and recognised the mute
      appeal that lay in her eyes. He smiled faintly, and hope rose in her
      troubled breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gunnings were there,&rdquo; put in Yvonne, puffing more rapidly than usual
      at her cigarette. &ldquo;They came to the box with Mr and Mrs Harbison during
      the intermission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What spiteful things did Mrs Harbison say about me?&rdquo; demanded Brood,
      affecting a certain lightness of manner. &ldquo;A cigarette, Ranjab. She
      despises me, I'm sure. Didn't she ask why I was not there to look after my
      beautiful and much-coveted wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said that you interested her more than any man she knew, and, of
      course, I considered that particularly spiteful. Her husband declared he
      would rather shoot with you than with any man in the world. He's very
      tiresome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've hunted a good bit together,&rdquo; said Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harbison says you are the most deadly shot he's ever seen,&rdquo; said
      Frederic, relaxing slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it he said about your wonderful accuracy with a revolver? What
      was it, Frederic? Hitting a shilling at some dreadful distance&mdash;thirty
      yards, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty paces,&rdquo; said Frederic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father often spoke of your shooting with a revolver, Mr Brood,&rdquo; said
      Lydia. &ldquo;He said it was really marvellous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne laughed. &ldquo;How interesting to have a husband who can even see as far
      as thirty paces. But revolver shooting is a doubtful accomplishment in
      these days of peace, isn't it? What is there to shoot at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad dogs and&mdash;men,&rdquo; said Brood. Lydia's look required an answer.
      &ldquo;No, I've never shot a mad dog, Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the young woman with the lisp, Freddy?&rdquo; asked Yvonne abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dangerfield. Isn't she amusing? I love that soft Virginia drawl of
      hers. She's pretty, too. Old Hodder was quite taken with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long, reverberating roll of thunder, ending in an ear-splitting crash
      that seemed no farther away than the window casement behind them, brought
      sharp exclamations of terror from the lips of the two women. The men,
      appalled, started to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, that <i>was</i> close!&rdquo; cried Frederic. &ldquo;There was no sign of
      a storm when we came in&mdash;just a steady, gentle spring rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am frightened,&rdquo; shuddered Yvonne, wide-eyed with fear. &ldquo;Do you think&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It struck near by, that's all,&rdquo; said Brood. &ldquo;Lightning bolts are
      deceptive. One may think they strike at one's very elbow, and yet the spot
      is really miles away. I hope your mother is not distressed, my dear,&rdquo;
       turning to Lydia. &ldquo;She is afraid of the lightning, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia sprang to her feet. &ldquo;I must go home at once, Mr Brood. She will be
      dreadfully frightened. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There came another deafening crash. The glare filled the room with a
      brilliant, greenish hue. Ranjab was standing at the window, holding the
      curtains apart while he peered upward across the space that separated them
      from the apartment building beyond the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me home, Frederic!&rdquo; cried Lydia frantically. She ran toward the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me telephone to your mother, Lyddy,&rdquo; he cried, hurrying after her
      into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo; she gasped as she ran. &ldquo;Don't come with me if you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as they raced down the stairs. &ldquo;Don't be
      frightened, darling. It's all right. Listen to me! Mrs Desmond is as safe
      as&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Freddy, Freddy!&rdquo; she wailed, breaking under a strain that he was not
      by way of comprehending. &ldquo;Oh, Freddy dear!&rdquo; Her nerves gave way. She was
      sobbing convulsively when they came to the lower hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      In great distress he clasped her in his arms, mumbling incoherent words of
      love, encouragement&mdash;even ridicule for the fear she betrayed. Far
      from his mind was the real cause of her unhappy plight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her close to his breast, and there she sobbed and trembled as with
      a mighty, racking chill. Her fingers clutched his arm with the grip of one
      who clings to the edge of a precipice with death below. Her face was
      buried against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; he murmured, appalled by this wild display of fear. &ldquo;Don't
      worry, darling. Everything is all right. Oh, you dear, dear girlie!
      Please, please! My little Lyddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me home, Freddy&mdash;take me home,&rdquo; she whispered brokenly. &ldquo;I
      cannot stay here another second. Come, dearest&mdash;come home with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still they stood there in the dark hall, clasped in each other's arms&mdash;stood
      there for many minutes without realising the lapse of time, thinking not
      of Mrs Desmond nor the storm that raged outside, but of the storm they
      were weathering together with the lightning racing through their veins,
      thunder in their heart-beats.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footstep in the hall. Frederic looked up, dazed, bewildered. Jones, the
      butler, was retreating through a door near by, having come upon them
      unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I beg pardon, sir. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jones! Listen! My raincoat&mdash;and father's, quick. And Miss
      Lydia's things. Yes, yes, it's all right, Jones. It's quite all right.&rdquo;
       Frederic was calling out the sentences jerkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite all right,&rdquo; repeated Jones, his throat swelling, his eyes suddenly
      dim. &ldquo;Quite, sir. Yes, yes!&rdquo; He rushed into the closet at the end of the
      hall, more grievously upset than he ever had been in all his life before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come with me, Freddy?&rdquo; she was whispering, clinging to him as
      one in panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Don't be frightened, Lyddy. I&mdash;I know everything is all
      right now. I'm sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am sure, too, dear. I have always been sure,&rdquo; she cried, and he
      understood, as she had understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the protests of Jones they dashed out into the blighting
      thunderstorm. The rain beat down in torrents, the din was infernal. As the
      door closed behind them Lydia, in the ecstasy of freedom from restraint
      bitterly imposed, gave vent to a shrill cry of relief. Words, the meaning
      of which he could not grasp, babbled from her lips as they descended the
      steps. One sentence fell vaguely clear from the others, and it puzzled
      him. He was sure that she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad, so happy we are out of that house&mdash;you and I
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Close together, holding tightly to each other, they breasted the swirling
      sheets of rain. The big umbrella was of little protection to them,
      although held manfully to break the force of the cold flood of waters.
      They bent their strong young bodies against the wind, and a sort of wild,
      impish hilarity took possession of them. It was freedom, after all! They
      were fighting a force in nature that they understood, and the sharp,
      staccato cries that came from their lips were born of an exultant glee
      which neither of them could have suppressed or controlled. Their hearts
      were as wild as the tempest about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned the corner and were flanked by the wind and rain. The long
      raincoats flattened their sleek, dripping folds tightly against their
      bodies. It was almost impossible to push forward into this mad deluge. The
      umbrella, caught by a gust, was turned inside out, and the full force of
      the storm struck upon their faces, almost taking the breath away. And they
      laughed as their arms tightened about each other. As one person they
      breasted the gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were fairly blown through the doors of the apartment-house. Mrs
      Desmond threw open the door as their wet, soggy feet came sloshing down
      the hall. Frederic's arm was about Lydia as they approached, and both of
      their drenched faces were wreathed in smiles&mdash;gay, exalted smiles.
      The mother, white-faced and fearful, stared for a second at the amazing
      pair, and then held out her arms to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was drenched in their embrace, but no one thought of the havoc that
      was being created in that swift, impulsive contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a fine mess we've made of your rug, Mrs Desmond,&rdquo; said Frederic
      ruefully a few minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; cried Lydia, aghast. Then they all realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take those horrid things off at once, both of you,&rdquo; commanded Mrs
      Desmond. Her voice trembled. &ldquo;And your shoes&mdash;and stockings. Dear,
      dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must run back home!&rdquo; exclaimed Frederic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia placed herself between him and the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I want you to stay!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not go out in that dreadful storm again. I will not let you go,
      Frederic. Stay&mdash;stay here with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared. &ldquo;What a funny idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until the rain is over,&rdquo; added Mrs Desmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Lydia. &ldquo;I mean for him to stay here the rest of the night.
      We can put you up, Freddy. I&mdash;I don't want you to go back there until&mdash;until
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glad light broke in his face. &ldquo;By Jove, I&mdash;do you know, I'd like to
      stay? I&mdash;I really would, Mrs Desmond. Can you find a place for me?&rdquo;
       His voice was eager, his eyes sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the mother quietly, almost serenely. &ldquo;You shall have Lydia's
      bed, Frederic. She can come in with me. Yes, you must stay. Are you not
      our Frederic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he stammered, and his eyes fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will telephone to Jones when the storm abates,&rdquo; said Mrs Desmond. &ldquo;Now
      get out of those coats, and&mdash;oh, dear, how wet you are! A hot drink
      for both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind asking Jones to send over something for me to wear in the
      morning?&rdquo; said Frederic, grinning as he stood forth in his evening
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, in a dressing-gown and bare feet, he sat with them
      before an open fire and sipped the toddy she had brewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, this is great!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia was suddenly shy and embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she whispered. Her fingers brushed his cheek lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her down to him and kissed her passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, my Lyddy!&rdquo; he said softly, his cheek flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went quickly from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later he stood in her sweet, dainty little bedroom and looked about him
      with a feeling of mingled awe and wonder. All of her intimate, exquisite
      belongings, the sanctified treasures of her most secret domain, were all
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fingered the articles on her dressing-table; smelled of the perfume
      bottles and smiled as he recognised the sweet odours as being a part of
      her, and not a thing unto themselves; grinned delightedly at his own
      photograph in its silver frame that stood where she could see it the last
      thing at night and the first in the morning; caressed&mdash;aye, caressed&mdash;the
      little hand-mirror that had reflected her gay or troubled face so many
      times since the dear Christmas Day when he had given it to her with his
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood beside her bed where she had stood, and the soft rug seemed to
      respond to the delightful tingling that ran through his bare feet. Her
      room! Her bed! Her domain!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he dropped to his knees and buried his hot face in the cool white
      sheets and kissed them over and over again. Here was sanctuary! His eyes
      were wet with tears when he arose to his feet, and his arms went out to
      the closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lyddy!&rdquo; he whispered chokingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back there in the rose-hued light of James Brood's study Yvonne cringed
      and shook in the strong arms of her husband all through that savage storm.
      She was no longer the defiant, self-possessed creature he had come to know
      so well, but a shrinking, trembling child, stripped of all her bravado,
      all her arrogance, all her seeming guile. A pathetic whimper crooned from
      her lips in response to his gentle words of reassurance. She was afraid&mdash;desperately
      afraid&mdash;and she crept close to him in her fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he? He was looking backward to another who had nestled close to him
      and whimpered as she was doing now&mdash;another who lived in terror when
      it stormed.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rederic opened his
      eyes at the sound of a gentle, persistent tapping on the bedroom door.
      Resting on his elbow, he looked blankly, wonderingly, about the room, and&mdash;remembered.
      The sun streamed into the chamber, filling it with a radiance that almost
      dazzled him. He rubbed his eyes, and again, as in the night just gone, his
      thought absorbed the contents of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not dreamed it, after all. He was there in Lydia's bed, attended by
      all the mute, inanimate sentinels that stood guard over her while she
      slept. The knocking continued. He dreamed on, his blinking eyes still
      seeking out the dainty, Lydia-like treasures in the enchanted room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic!&rdquo; called a voice outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started guiltily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was his cheery response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up! It's nine o'clock. Or will you have your breakfast in bed, sir?&rdquo;
       It was Lydia who spoke, assuming a fine Irish brogue in imitation of their
      little maid of all work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to, unless my clothes have come over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are here. Now do hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang out of bed and bounded across the room. She passed the garments
      through the partly opened door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; he greeted, sticking his tousled head around the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; she responded as briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't wait breakfast for me. I'll skip over home&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be ready in fifteen minutes,&rdquo; she said arbitrarily. &ldquo;Don't
      dawdle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pretty, how sweet you are this morning,&rdquo; he cried, his dark eyes
      dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; she scoffed, but with a radiant smile. Then, with a perfectly
      childish giggle, she slammed the door and scurried away as if in fear of
      pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was artistic, temperamental. Such as he have not the capacity for haste
      when there is the slightest opportunity to dream and dawdle. He was a full
      quarter of an hour taking his tub, and another was consumed in getting
      into his clothes. At home he was always much longer than this, for he was
      delayed by the additional task of selecting shirts, ties, socks, and
      scarf-pins, and changing his mind and all of them three or four times
      before being satisfied with the effect. He sallied forth in great haste at
      nine thirty-five, and was extremely proud of himself, although unshaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first act, after warmly greeting Mrs Desmond, was to sit down at the
      piano. Hurriedly he played a few jerky, broken snatches of the haunting
      air he had heard the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been wondering if I could remember it,&rdquo; he apologised, as he
      followed them into the dining-room. &ldquo;What's the matter, Lyddy? Didn't you
      sleep well? Poor old girl, I was a beast to deprive you of your bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a mean headache, that's all,&rdquo; said the girl quickly. He noticed
      the dark circles under her eyes and the queer expression, as of trouble,
      in their depths. &ldquo;It will go as soon as I've had my coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Night, with its wonderful sensations, was behind them. Day revealed the
      shadow that had fallen. They unconsciously shrank from it and drew back
      into the shelter of their own misgivings. The joyous abandon of the night
      before was dead. Over its grave stood the leering spectre of unrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he took her in his arms later on, and kissed her, there was not the
      shadow of a doubt in the mind of either that the restraining influence of
      a condition over which they had no control was there to mock their
      endeavour to be natural. They were not to be deceived by the apparent
      earnestness of the embrace. Each knew that the other was asking a
      question, even as their lips met and clung in the rather pathetic attempt
      to confirm the fond dream of the night before. They kissed as through a
      veil. They were awake once more, and they were wary, unconvinced. The
      answer to their questions came in the kiss itself, and constraint fell
      upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawn by an impulse that had been struggling within him, Frederic found
      himself standing at the sitting-room window. It was a sly, covert, though
      intensely eager look that he directed at another window far below. If he
      hoped for some sign of life in his father's study he was to be
      disappointed. The curtains hung straight and motionless. He would have
      denied the charge that he longed to see Yvonne sitting in the casement,
      waiting to waft a sign of greeting up to him; he would have denied that
      the thought was in his mind when he went to the window; and yet he was
      conscious of a feeling of disappointment, even annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With considerable adroitness Lydia engaged his attention at the piano.
      Keyed up as she was, his every emotion was plain to her perceptions. She
      had anticipated the motive that led him to the window. She knew that it
      would assert itself in spite of all that he could do to prevent. She
      waited humbly for the thing to happen, pain in her heart, and when her
      reading proved true she was prepared to combat its effect. Music was her
      only ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does it go, Freddy&mdash;the thing you were playing before
      breakfast?&rdquo; She was trying to pick up the elusive air. &ldquo;It is such a
      fascinating, adorable thing. Is this right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch. The few bars she had mastered in her eagerness
      fell upon inattentive ears at first. But she persisted. He came over and
      stood beside her. His long, slim fingers joined hers on the keyboard, and
      the sensuous strains of the waltz responded to his touch. He smiled
      patiently as she struggled to repeat what he had played. The fever of the
      thing took hold of him at last, as she had known it would. Leaning over
      her shoulder, his cheek quite close to hers, he played. Her hands dropped
      into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      She retained her seat on the bench. Her cunning brain told her that it
      would be a mistake to relinquish her place at the keyboard. He would play
      it through a time or two, mechanically perhaps, and then his interest
      would be gone. He would have gratified her simple request, and that would
      have been the end. She led him on by interrupting time and again in her
      eagerness to grasp the lesson he was giving. Finally she moved over on the
      bench, and he sat down beside her. He was absorbed in the undertaking. His
      brow cleared. His smile was a happy, eager one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a tricky thing, Lyddy,&rdquo; he said enthusiastically, &ldquo;but you'll get
      it. Now listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an hour they sat there, master and pupil, sweetheart and lover. The
      fear was less in the heart of one when, tiring at last, the other
      contentedly abandoned the rôle of taskmaster and threw himself upon the
      couch, remarking, as he stretched himself in luxurious ease:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like this, Lyddy. I wish you didn't have to go over there and dig away
      at that confounded journal. I like this so well that, 'pon my soul, I'd
      enjoy loafing here with you the whole day long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her heart leaped. &ldquo;You shall have your wish, Freddy,&rdquo; she said, barely
      able to conceal the note of eagerness in her voice. &ldquo;I am not going to
      work to-day. I&mdash;my head, you know. Mother telephoned to Mr Brood this
      morning before you were up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going to loaf?&rdquo; he cried gladly. &ldquo;Bully! And I may stay? But, gee,
      I forgot your headache. It will&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He was staring up
      from the couch when she hastily broke in, shaking her head vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie still. My head is much better. I want you to stay, dear. I&mdash;I
      want to have you all to myself again. Oh, it will be so good&mdash;so good
      to while away an idle day with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing beside the couch. He reached forth and took her hand in
      his, laying it against his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be an idle day,&rdquo; said he seriously. &ldquo;We shall be very busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy?&rdquo; she inquired apprehensively.
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking things over,&rdquo; he said
      briefly. &ldquo;Of course, I ought to go home and face the music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's something I can't talk about, Lyddy. Let's forget our troubles for
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better still, let us share them. Stay here with me. Don't go home to-day,
      Freddy. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've got to have it out with father some time,&rdquo; he said bitterly. &ldquo;It
      may as well be now as later on. We've got to come to an understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her heart was cold. She was afraid of what would come out of that
      &ldquo;understanding.&rdquo; All night long she had lain with wide-staring eyes,
      thinking of the horrid thing James Brood had said to her. Far in the night
      she aroused her mother from a sound sleep to put the question that had
      been torturing her for hours. Mrs Desmond confessed that her husband had
      told her that Brood had never considered Frederic to be his son, and then
      the two lay side by side for the remainder of the night without uttering a
      word, and yet keenly awake. They were thinking of the hour when Brood
      would serve notice on the intruder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia now realised that the hour was near. Frederic himself would
      challenge the wrath of all these bitter years, and it would fall upon his
      unsuspecting head with cruel, obliterating force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shivered as with a racking chill. &ldquo;Have it out with father,&rdquo; he
      had said in his ignorance. He was preparing to rush headlong to his doom.
      To prevent that catastrophe was the single, all-absorbing thought in
      Lydia's mind. Her only hope lay in keeping the men apart until she could
      extract from Brood a promise to be merciful, and this she intended to
      accomplish if she had to go down on her knees and grovel before the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Freddy,&rdquo; she cried earnestly, &ldquo;why take the chance of making a bad
      matter worse?&rdquo; Even as she uttered the words she realised how stupid, how
      ineffectual they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be much worse,&rdquo; he said gloomily. &ldquo;I am inclined to think he'd
      relish a straight-out, fair, and square talk, anyhow. Moreover, I mean to
      take Yvonne to task for the thing she said&mdash;or implied last night.
      About you, I mean. She&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg of you, don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;unspeakable. I don't see what could have come over her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was jealous. She admitted it, dear. If I don't mind, why should you
      incur&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really believe she&mdash;she loves the governor enough to be as
      jealous as all that?&rdquo; he exclaimed, a curious gleam in his eyes&mdash;an
      expression she did not like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I think so!&rdquo; she cried emphatically. &ldquo;What a question! Have you
      any reason to suspect that she does not love your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;certainly not,&rdquo; he said in some confusion. Then, after a moment:
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure this headache of yours is real, Lyddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it an excuse to stay away from&mdash;from Yvonne, after what
      happened last night? Be honest, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a long time, weighing her answer. Was it best to be
      honest with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess that it has something to do with it,&rdquo; she admitted. Lydia could
      not be anything but truthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. It's&mdash;it's a rotten shame, Lyddy. That's why I want to
      talk to her. I want to reason with her. It's all so perfectly silly, this
      misunderstanding. You've just got to go on as you were before, Lyddy&mdash;just
      as if it hadn't happened. It&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall complete the work for your father, Freddy,&rdquo; she said quietly.
      &ldquo;Two or three days more will see the end. After that neither my services
      nor my presence will be required over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, unbelievingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't likely I'd go there for pleasure, is it?&rdquo; she interrupted dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think of the old times, the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can think of them just as well here as anywhere else. No; I shan't
      annoy Mrs Brood, Freddy.&rdquo; It was on the tip of her tongue to say more, but
      she thought better of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're going abroad soon,&rdquo; he ventured. &ldquo;At least, that's father's plan.
      Yvonne isn't so keen about it. She calls this being abroad, you know.
      Besides,&rdquo; he hurried on in his eagerness to excuse Yvonne, &ldquo;she's
      tremendously fond of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia was wise. &ldquo;I would give a great deal to be able to really believe
      so, Freddy. I&mdash;I could be very fond of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He warmed to the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No end of times she's said you were the finest&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her
      smile&mdash;an odd one, such as he had never seen on her lips before&mdash;checked
      his eager speech. He bridled. &ldquo;Of course, if you don't choose to believe
      me, there's nothing more to be said. She meant it, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure she said it, Freddy,&rdquo; she hastened to declare. &ldquo;Will she be
      pleased with our&mdash;our marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It required a great deal of courage on her part to utter these words, but
      she was determined to bring the true situation home to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not even hesitate, and there was conviction in his voice as he
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter whether she's pleased or displeased. We're pleasing
      ourselves, are we not? There's no one else to consider, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were full upon his, and there was wonder in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;thank you, Freddy,&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I knew you'd&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The sentence remained
      unfinished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has there ever been a doubt in your mind?&rdquo; he asked uneasily, after a
      moment. He knew there had been misgivings, and he was ready, in his
      self-abasement, to resent them if given the slightest opening. Guilt made
      him arrogant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was not what he expected. He flushed painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought perhaps you'd&mdash;you'd get a notion in your head
      that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He, too, stopped for want of the right words to
      express himself without committing the egregious error of letting her see
      that it had been in his thoughts to accuse her of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited for a moment. &ldquo;That I might have got the notion in my head you
      did not love me any longer? Is that what you started to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he confessed, averting his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been unhappy at times, Freddy, but that is all,&rdquo; she said steadily.
      &ldquo;You see, I know how honest you really are. I know it far better than you
      know it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder just how honest I am,&rdquo; he muttered.
      &ldquo;I wonder what would happen if&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; But nothing can
      happen. Nothing ever will happen. Thank you, old girl, for saying what you
      said just now. It's&mdash;it's bully of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and began pacing the floor. She leaned back in her chair,
      deliberately giving him time to straighten out his thoughts for himself.
      Wiser than she knew herself to be, she held back the warm, loving words of
      encouragement, of gratitude, of belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was not prepared for the impetuous appeal that followed. He threw
      himself down beside her and grasped her hands in his. His face seemed
      suddenly old and haggard, his eyes burned like coals of fire. Then, for
      the first time, she had an inkling of the great struggle that had been
      going on inside of him for weeks and weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Lyddy,&rdquo; he began nervously; &ldquo;will you marry me to-morrow? Are you
      willing to take the chance that I'll be able to support you, to earn
      enough&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Freddy!&rdquo; she cried, half starting up from the couch. She was
      dumbfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you? Will you? I mean it,&rdquo; he went on, almost argumentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very much in earnest, but alas! the fire, the passion of the
      importunate lover was missing. She shrank back into the corner of the
      couch, staring at him with puzzled eyes. Comprehension was slow in
      arriving. As he hurried on with his plea she began to see clearly, her
      sound brain grasped the significance of this sudden decision on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no use waiting, dear. I'll never be more capable of earning a
      living than I am right now. I can go into the office with Brooks any day,
      and I&mdash;I think I can make good. God knows, I can try hard enough. Brooks
      says he's got a place there for me in the bond department. It won't be
      much at first, but I can work into a pretty good&mdash;what's the matter?
      Don't you think I can do it? Have you no faith in me? Are you afraid to
      take a chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had smiled sadly&mdash;it seemed to him reprovingly. His cheek
      flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has put all this into your head, Freddy dear?&rdquo; she asked shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, good Lord, haven't we had this very thing in mind for years?&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Haven't we talked about my&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What put it into your head&mdash;just now?&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you're driving at,&rdquo; he floundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think it would be safer&mdash;I mean wiser if you were to wait
      until you are quite certain of yourself, Freddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain of myself,&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;What do you mean? What sort of
      talk is this you are&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Don't be angry, dear. Be honest now. Don't you understand just what
      I mean?&rdquo; They looked squarely into each other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to marry me at once,&rdquo; said he doggedly. &ldquo;You know I love you,
      Lyddy. Is there anything more to say than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you want to tell me, Freddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes wavered. &ldquo;I can't go on living as I have been for the past few
      months. I've just got to end it, Lyddy. You don't understand&mdash;you
      can't, and there isn't any use in trying to explain the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do understand, dear,&rdquo; she said quietly, laying her hand on his.
      &ldquo;I understand so completely that there isn't any use in your trying to
      explain. But don't you think you are a bit cowardly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cowardly?&rdquo; he gasped, and then the blood rushed to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it quite fair to me&mdash;or to yourself?&rdquo; He was silent. She waited
      for a moment and then went on resolutely. &ldquo;I know just what it is that you
      are afraid of, Freddy. I shall marry you, of course. I love you more than
      anything else in all the world. But are you quite fair in asking me to
      marry you while you are still afraid, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before God, Lyddy, I love no one else but you!&rdquo; he cried earnestly. &ldquo;I
      know what it is you are thinking, and I&mdash;I don't blame you. But I
      want you <i>now</i>&mdash;you don't know how much I need you now! I want
      to begin a new life with you. I want to feel that you are with me&mdash;just
      you&mdash;strong and brave and enduring. I am adrift. I need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you love me, Frederic. I am absolutely certain of it,&rdquo; she said
      slowly, weighing her words carefully. &ldquo;But I cannot marry you to-morrow&mdash;nor
      for a long time after to-morrow. In a year&mdash;yes. But not now, dear;
      not just now. You&mdash;you understand, don't you? Say that you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His chin sank upon his breast. &ldquo;Of course I understand,&rdquo; he said in a very
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never love you any more than I love you now, Freddy&mdash;never
      so much, perhaps, as at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Lyddy; I know,&rdquo; he said dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you insist, I will marry you to-morrow; but you cannot&mdash;you will
      not ask it of me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know I do love you,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There isn't any doubt in your
      mind, Lyddy. There is no one else I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am just beginning to understand men,&rdquo; she remarked
      enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to wonder why they call women the weaker sex, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, so seriously that the wry smile died on his lips. &ldquo;I
      don't believe there are many women who would ask a man to be sorry for
      them. That's really what all this amounts to, isn't it, Freddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a strong, self-willed, chivalrous man, and yet you think nothing
      of asking a woman to protect you against yourself; You are afraid to stand
      alone. Wait! You need me because you are a strong man and are afraid that
      your very strength will lead you into ignoble warfare. You are afraid of
      your strength, not of your weakness. So you ask me to help you. Without
      thinking, you ask me to marry you to-morrow. The idea came to you like a
      flash of light in the darkness. Five minutes&mdash;yes, one minute before
      you asked it of me, Freddy dear, you were floundering in the darkness,
      uncertain which way to turn. You were afraid of the things you could not
      see. You looked for some place in which to hide. The flash of light
      revealed a haven of refuge. So you asked me to to marry you to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All through this indictment she had held his hand clasped tightly in both
      of hers. He was looking at her with a frank acknowledgment growing in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ashamed of me, Lyddy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, meeting his gaze
      steadily. &ldquo;I am a little disappointed, that's all. It is you who are
      ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said he simply. &ldquo;It wasn't fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love will endure. I am content to wait,&rdquo; she said with a wistful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be my wife, no matter what happens? You won't let this make any
      difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not angry with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry? Why should I be angry with you, Lyddy? For shaking some sense into
      me? For seeing through me with that wonderful, far-sighted brain of yours?
      Why, I could go down on my knees to you. I could&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think, Freddy,&rdquo; she cried, suddenly confronted by her own
      declaration of the night before. She had told James Brood that she would
      marry this discredited son of his the instant he was ready to take her
      unto himself. She had flung that in the older man's face, and she had
      meant every word of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I take back what I said, dear. I will marry you to-morrow.&rdquo; She
      spoke rapidly, jerkily; her eyes were very dark and luminous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has come over you?&rdquo; He stared at her in astonishment. &ldquo;What&mdash;oh,
      I see! You are not sure of me. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I am! It isn't that. I did not know what I was saying when I
      refused to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there you go, just like a woman!&rdquo; he cried triumphantly. &ldquo;Spoiling
      everything! You dear, lovable, inconsequent, regular girl! Hurray! Now
      we're back where we began, and I'm holding the whip. You bring me to my
      senses and then promptly lose your own.&rdquo; He clasped her in his arms and
      held her close. &ldquo;You dear, dear Lyddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it, dear heart.&rdquo; The whisper smothered in his embrace.
      &ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;to-day, if you will. We will go away. We will&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, quite resolutely; &ldquo;you have shown me the way. I've just got
      to make good in your estimation before I can hold you to your promise.
      You're splendid, Lyddy; you're wonderful, but&mdash;well, I was unfair a
      while ago. I mean to be fair now. We'll wait. It's better so. I will come
      again and ask you, but it won't be as it was just now. It would not be
      right for me to take you at your word. We'll wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke for many minutes. It was she who broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must promise one thing, Frederic. For my sake, avoid a quarrel with
      your father. I could not bear that. You will promise, dear? You must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't intend to quarrel with him; but if I am to remain in his house
      there has got to be&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      He paused, his jaw set stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me you will wait. He is going away in two weeks. When he returns&mdash;later
      on&mdash;next fall&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if it really distresses you, Lyddy, I'll&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does distress me. I want your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do my part,&rdquo; he said resignedly, &ldquo;and next fall will see us married,
      so&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The telephone-bell in the hall was ringing. Frederic released
      Lydia's hand and sat up rather stiffly, as one who suddenly suspects that
      he is being spied upon. The significance of the movement did not escape
      Lydia. She laughed mirthlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see who it is,&rdquo; she said, and arose. Two red spots appeared in his
      cheeks. Then it was that she realised he had been waiting all along for
      the bell to ring; he had been expecting a summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's for me, please say&mdash;er&mdash;say I'll&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began, somewhat disjointedly, but she interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stay here for luncheon, Frederic? And this afternoon we will go
      to&mdash;oh, is there a concert or a recital&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll stay if you'll let me,&rdquo; he said wistfully. &ldquo;We'll find
      something to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to the telephone. He heard the polite greetings, the polite
      assurances that she had not taken cold, two or three laughing rejoinders
      to what must have been amusing comments on the storm and its effect on
      timid creatures, and then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs Brood, I will call him to the phone.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rederic had the
      feeling that he slunk to the telephone. The girl handed the receiver to
      him and he met her confident, untroubled gaze for a second. Instead of
      returning to the sitting-room where she could have heard everything that
      he said, she went into her own room down the hall and closed the door. He
      was not conscious of any intention to temporise, but it was significant
      that he did not speak until the door closed behind her. Afterward he
      realised and was ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost the first words that Yvonne uttered were of a nature to puzzle and
      irritate him, although they bore directly upon his own previously formed
      resolution. Her voice, husky and low, seemed strangely plaintive and
      lifeless to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you and Lydia made any plans for the afternoon?&rdquo; she inquired. He
      made haste to declare their intention to attend a concert. &ldquo;I am glad you
      are going to do that,&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill, Yvonne?&rdquo; he queried suddenly. &ldquo;I? Oh, no. I think I never
      felt better in my life than I do at this moment. The storm must have blown
      the cobwebs out of my brain. I believe I'm quite happy to-day, Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you always happy?&rdquo; he cried chidingly. &ldquo;What an odd thing to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not respond to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will stay for luncheon with Lydia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She's trying to pick up that thing of Feverelli's&mdash;the one we
      heard last night.&rdquo; There was silence at the other end of the wire, &ldquo;Are
      you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm teaching it to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be home for dinner, of course. You&mdash;you don't need me for
      anything, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. Then, with a low laugh: &ldquo;You may be excused for the day,
      my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong?&rdquo; he demanded, lowering his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong? Nothing is wrong. Everything seems right to me. Your father and I
      have been discussing the trip abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is it settled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We are to sail on the twenty-fifth&mdash;in ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settled, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you&mdash;you were opposed to going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've changed my mind. As a matter of fact, I've changed my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak in riddles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father has gone out to arrange for passage on the <i>Olympic</i>. He
      is lunching at the Lawyers' Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will lunch alone, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suppressed an impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic, I want you to do something for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I've promised Lydia to stay here&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn't that. Will you try to convince Lydia that I meant no offence
      last night when I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She understands all that perfectly, Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she doesn't. A woman <i>wouldn't</i> understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will square everything,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means a great deal to me,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman likes to be regarded as a fool,&rdquo; she said at last, apparently
      after careful reflection.
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; there is something else. We are dining out this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I?&rdquo; he asked, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Your father and I. I was about to suggest that you dine
      with Lydia&mdash;or, better still, ask her over here to share your dinner
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was scowling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going? Oh, dining. I see. Well,&rdquo; slowly, deliberately, &ldquo;we thought it
      would be great fun to dine alone at Delmonico's and see a play afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just&mdash;you and father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We two&mdash;no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cunning,&rdquo; he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ask Lydia to dine with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will go out somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have dinner with Mr Dawes and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be jolly. They will be pleased. A sort of&mdash;what do you
      call it&mdash;a sort of reunion, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you making sport of me?&rdquo; he demanded angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no! It will be making sport for the old gentleman, though, <i>aïe?</i>
      And now <i>au revoir!</i> You will surely convince Lydia that I love her?
      I am troubled. You will&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What play are you going to see?&rdquo; he cut in. She mentioned a Belasco
      production. &ldquo;Well, I hope you enjoy it, Yvonne. By the way, how is the
      governor to-day? In a good humour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no response. He waited for a moment and then called out: &ldquo;Are
      you there?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; came back over the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, as if she had given him a slap in the face. Her voice was cold
      and forbidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lydia rejoined him in the sitting-room he was standing at the window,
      staring across the courtyard far below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; she asked steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned toward her, conscious of the tell-tale scowl that was passing
      from his brow. It did not occur to him to resent her abrupt,
      uncompromising question. As a matter of fact, it seemed quite natural that
      she should put the question in just that way, flatly, incisively. He
      considered himself, in a way, to be on trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You did not expect me to forget, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was uncomfortable under her honest, inquiring gaze. A sullen anger
      against himself took possession of him. He despised himself for the
      feeling of loneliness and homesickness that suddenly came over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, and then her brow cleared. &ldquo;I
      have been looking up the recitals in the morning paper. The same orchestra
      you heard last night is to appear again to-day at&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go there, Lydia,&rdquo; he interrupted, and at once began to hum the
      gay little air that had so completely charmed him. &ldquo;Try it again, Lyddy.
      You'll get it in no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After luncheon, like two happy children they rushed off to the concert,
      and it was not until they were on their way home at five o'clock that his
      enthusiasm began to wane. She was quick to detect the change. He became
      moody, preoccupied; his part of the conversation was kept up with an
      effort that lacked all of the spontaneity of his earlier and more engaging
      flights.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode down town on the top of a Fifth Avenue stage, having it all to
      themselves. She found herself speculating on the change that had come over
      him, and soon lapsed into a reserve quite as pronounced as his own. By the
      time they were ready to get down at the corner above Brood's house there
      was no longer any pretence at conversation between them. The day's fire
      had burned out. Its glow had given way to the bleak, gray tone of dead
      coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia went far back in her calculations and attributed his mood to the
      promise she had exacted in regard to his attitude toward his father. It
      occurred to her that he was smarting under the restraint that promise
      involved. She realised now, more than ever before, that there could be no
      delay, no faltering on her part. She would have to see James Brood at
      once; go down on her knees to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel rather guilty, Freddy,&rdquo; she said as they approached the house. &ldquo;Mr
      Brood will think it strange that I should plead a headache and yet run off
      to a concert and enjoy myself when he is so eager to finish the journal&mdash;especially
      as he is to sail so soon. I ought to see him; don't you think so? Perhaps
      there is something I can do to-night that will make up for the lost time.&rdquo;
       She was plainly nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd work you to death if he thought it would serve his purpose,&rdquo; said
      Frederic gloomily. And back of that sentence lay the thought that made it
      absolutely imperative for her to act without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go in for a few minutes,&rdquo; she said, at the foot of the steps. &ldquo;Are
      you not coming, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had stopped. &ldquo;Not just now, Lyddy. I think I'll run up to Tom's flat
      and smoke a pipe with him. Thanks, old girl, for the happy day we've had.
      You don't mind if I leave you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her heart gave a great throb of relief. It was best to have him out of the
      way for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do go and see Tom. I shan't be here long. We have
      had a glorious day, haven't we?&rdquo; There was something wistful in her smile
      as she held out her hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He searched her face with tired, yearning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have thousands of them ahead of us, Lyddy&mdash;days that will be all our
      own, with nothing else in them but ourselves. I&mdash;I wish we could
      begin them to-morrow, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush mounted to her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Freddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed reluctant to release her hand; her hand was cold, but her eyes
      were shining with a glorious warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I may run in to see you this evening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You won't mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, by all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;so-long,&rdquo; he said diffidently. &ldquo;So-long, Lyddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-long,&rdquo; she repeated, dropping into his manner of speech without
      thinking. There was a smothering sensation in her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked back as he strode off in the direction from which they had come.
      She was at the top of the steps, her finger on the electric button. He
      wondered why her face was so white. He had always thought of it as being
      full of colour, rich, soft, and warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the door Lydia experienced a strange sinking of the heart. Her
      limbs seemed curiously weak, and she was conscious of a feeling of utter
      loneliness, such as she had never known before. She looked about her in
      wonder, as if seeking an explanation for the extraordinary but fleeting
      impression that she was in a strange house. Never was she to find an
      interpretation of the queer fantasy that came and went almost in the span
      of a single breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr Brood at&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice at the top of the stairway interrupted the question she was
      putting to the footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Lydia? Come up to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked up and saw Mrs Brood leaning over the banister-rail. She
      was holding her pink dressing-gown closely about her throat, as if it had
      been hastily thrown about her shoulders. One bare arm was visible&mdash;completely
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to see Mr Brood. Is he&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is busy. Come up to my room,&rdquo; repeated Yvonne, somewhat imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lydia mounted the stairs she had a fair glimpse of the other's face.
      Always pallid&mdash;but of a healthy pallor&mdash;it was now almost
      ghastly. Perhaps it was the light from the window that caused it; Lydia
      was not sure, but a queer greenish hue overspread the lovely, smiling
      face. The lips were red, very red&mdash;redder than she had ever seen them. The
      girl suddenly recalled the face she had once seen of a woman who was
      addicted to the drug habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood met her at the top of the stairs. She was but half dressed. Her
      lovely neck and shoulders were now almost bare. Her hands were extended
      toward the visitor; the filmy lace gown hung loose and disregarded about
      her slim figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, dear. Shall we have tea? I have been so lonely. One cannot read
      the books they print nowadays. Such stupid things, <i>aïe?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw an arm about the tall girl, and Lydia was surprised to find that
      it was warm and full of a gentle strength. She felt her flesh tingle with
      the thrill of contact. Yes, it must have been the light from the window,
      for Yvonne's face was now aglow with the peculiar iridescence that was so
      peculiarly her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      A door closed softly on the floor above them. Mrs Brood glanced over her
      shoulder and upward. Her arm tightened perceptibly about Lydia's waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Ranjab,&rdquo; said the girl, and instantly was filled with amazement.
      She had not seen the Hindu, had not even been thinking of him, and yet she
      was impelled by some mysterious intelligence to give utterance to a
      statement in which there was conviction, not conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; asked the other, looking at her sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Lydia, still amazed. &ldquo;I don't know why I said that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood closed her boudoir door behind them. For an instant she stood
      staring at the knob, as if expecting to see it turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know why you said it. Because it <i>was</i>
      Ranjab.&rdquo; She shivered slightly.
      &ldquo;I am afraid of that man, Lydia. He seems to be watching me all the time.
      Day and night his eyes seem to be upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, should he be watching you?&rdquo; asked Lydia bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne did not notice the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even when I am asleep in my bed, in the dead hour of night, he is looking
      at me. I can feel it. Oh, it is not a dream, for my dreams are of
      something or someone else&mdash;never of him. And yet he is there, looking
      at me. It&mdash;it is uncanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagination,&rdquo; remarked Lydia quietly. &ldquo;He never struck me as especially
      omnipresent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you <i>feel</i> him a moment ago?&rdquo; demanded Yvonne irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other hesitated, reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it must have been something like that.&rdquo; They were still facing
      the door, standing close together. &ldquo;Why do you feel that he is watching
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I just feel it, that's all. Day and night. He can read my
      thoughts, Lydia, as he would read a book. Isn't&mdash;isn't it
      disgusting?&rdquo; Her laugh was spiritless, obviously artificial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't object to his reading my thoughts,&rdquo; said Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you are Lydia. It's different. I have thoughts sometimes, my
      dear, that would not&mdash;but there! Let us speak of more agreeable
      things. Take off your coat&mdash;here, let me help you. What a lovely
      waist! You will pardon my costume, won't you, or rather the lack of one?
      I shan't dress until dinner-time. Sit down here beside me. No tea? A
      cigarette, then. No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never smoke, you remember,&rdquo; said the other. She was looking at Yvonne
      now with a curious, new-found interest in her serious eyes. &ldquo;I came to
      explain to Mr Brood how it happens that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poof! Never explain, my dear, never explain anything to a man!&rdquo; cried
      Yvonne, lighting a cigarette. The flare of the match in the partially
      darkened room lit up her face with merciless candour. Lydia was conscious
      once more of the unusual pallor and a certain haggardness about the dark
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is so eager to complete the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you forgive me for what I said to you last night?&rdquo; demanded Yvonne,
      sitting down beside the girl on the <i>chaise longue</i>. The interruption
      was rude, perhaps, but it was impossible to resent it, so appealing was
      the expression in the offender's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so absurd, Mrs Brood, that I have scarcely given it a moment's
      thought. Of course, I was hurt at the time. It was so unjust to Mr Brood.
      It was&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like you to say that!&rdquo; cried Yvonne. &ldquo;You are splendid, Lydia. Will
      you believe me when I tell you that I love you&mdash;that I love you very
      dearly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia looked at her in some doubt, and not without misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to believe it,&rdquo; she said noncommittally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you doubt it. I see. Well, I do not blame you. I have given you
      much pain, much distress. When I am far away you will be glad&mdash;you will be
      happy. Is not that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are coming back,&rdquo; said Lydia with a frank smile, not meant to be
      unfriendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne's face clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall probably come back. Nothing is sure in this queer world of
      ours.&rdquo; She threw her cigarette away. &ldquo;I don't like it to-day. Ugh! how it
      tastes in my mouth!&rdquo; She drew closer to the girl's side. Lydia's nostrils
      filled with the strange, sweet perfume that she affected, so individually
      hers, so personally Yvonne. &ldquo;Oh, yes; I shall come back. Why not? Is not
      this my home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may call it your home, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; said
      Lydia, &ldquo;but are you quite sure your thoughts always abide here? I mean in
      the United States, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne had looked up at her quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. No; I shall never be an American.&rdquo; Then she abruptly changed
      the subject. &ldquo;You have had a nice day with Frederic? You have been happy,
      both of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;very happy, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; said the girl simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad. You must always be happy, you two. It is my greatest wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic asked me to be his wife&mdash;to-morrow,&rdquo; she said, and her heart
      began to thump queerly. She felt that she was approaching a crisis of some
      sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; fell from Yvonne's lips. The word was drawn out, as if in one
      long breath. Then, to Lydia's astonishment, an extraordinary change came
      over the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; it should be&mdash;it must be to-morrow. Poor boy&mdash;poor,
      poor boy! You will marry, yes, and go way at once, <i>aïe?</i>&rdquo; Her voice
      was almost shrill in its intensity, her eyes were wide and eager and&mdash;anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Mrs Brood, is it for the best?&rdquo; cried Lydia.
      &ldquo;Is it the best thing for Frederic to do? I&mdash;I feared you might
      object. I am sure his father will refuse permission&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you love each other&mdash;that is enough. Why ask the consent of
      anyone? Yes, yes, it is for the best. I know&mdash;oh, you cannot realise
      how well I know. You must not hesitate.&rdquo; The woman was trembling in her
      eagerness. Lydia's astonishment gave way to perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Why are you so serious&mdash;so intent on this&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic has no money,&rdquo; pursued Yvonne, as if she had not heard Lydia's
      words. &ldquo;But that must not deter you&mdash;it must not stand in the way. I
      shall find a way; yes, I shall find a way. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you would provide for him for us?&rdquo; exclaimed Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a way, there is a way,&rdquo; said the other, fixing her eyes
      appealingly on the girl's face, to which the flush of anger was slowly
      mounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father will not help him&mdash;if, that is what you are counting
      upon, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; said the girl coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. He will not help him; no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about&mdash;what has Mr Brood said to you?&rdquo; Her heart
      was cold with apprehension. &ldquo;Why are you going away next week? What has
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood's wife was regarding her with narrowing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you attributing my motives to something that my husband has said to
      me? Am I expected to say that he has&mdash;what you call it&mdash;that he
      has put his foot down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry you misunderstood my&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see now. You think my husband suspects that Frederic is too deeply
      interested in his beautiful stepmother; is not that so? Poof! It has
      nothing to do with it.&rdquo; Her eyes were sullen, full of resentment now. She
      was collecting herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's eyes expressed the disdain that suddenly took the place of
      apprehension in her thoughts. A sharp retort leaped to her lips, but she
      suppressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Brood does not like Frederic,&rdquo; she said instead, and could have cut
      out her tongue the instant the words were uttered. Yvonne's eyes were
      glittering with a light that she had never seen in them before. Afterward
      she described it to herself as baleful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! He has spoken ill&mdash;evil&mdash;of his son to you?&rdquo; she said,
      almost in a monotone, &ldquo;He has hated him for years&mdash;is not that so? I
      am not the original cause, <i>aïe?</i> It began long ago&mdash;long, long
      ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg of you, Mrs Brood&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
      Lydia, shrinking back in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are free to speak your thoughts to me. I shall not be offended. What
      has he said to you about Frederic&mdash;and me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I swear to you; nothing!&rdquo; cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have the power of observation. You do not have to be told in so
      many words. You have been with him a great deal, alone. His manner tells
      you what his lips hold back. Tell me.&rdquo; Lydia resolved to take the plunge.
      Now was the time to speak plainly to this woman of the thing that was
      hurting her almost beyond the limits of endurance. Her voice was rather
      high-pitched. She had the fear that she would not be able to control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be blind not to have observed the cruel position in which you
      are placing Frederic. Is it surprising that your husband has eyes as well
      as I? What must be his thoughts, Mrs Brood?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She expected an outburst, a
      torrent of indignation, an angry storm of words, and was therefore
      unprepared for the piteous, hunted expression that came swiftly into the
      lovely eyes, bent so appealing upon her own, which were cold and accusing.
      Here was a new phase to this extraordinary creature's character. She was a
      coward, after all, and Lydia despised a coward. The look of scorn deepened
      in her eyes, and out from her heart rushed all that was soft and tender in
      her nature, leaving it barren of all compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want to hurt Frederic,&rdquo; murmured
      Yvonne. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am sorry if&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hurting him dreadfully,&rdquo; said Lydia, suddenly choking up with
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not&mdash;not in love with me,&rdquo; declared Yvonne,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the girl, regaining control of herself, &ldquo;he is not in love with
      you. That is the whole trouble. He is in love with me. But&mdash;but can't
      you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wise young woman to know men so well,&rdquo; said the other
      enigmatically. &ldquo;I have never believed in St Anthony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Lydia, and was surprised at herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to put my faith in the women who tempted him,&rdquo; said Yvonne,
      drawing a little closer to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right. They at least were not pretending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that. At any rate, they succeeded in making a saint
      of him eventually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are undertaking a similar office in&mdash;in Frederic's
      behalf,&rdquo; said Lydia with fine irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you consider me to be a bad woman, Lydia?&rdquo; Her lips trembled. There
      was a suspicious quiver to her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I do not,&rdquo; pronounced the girl flatly. &ldquo;If I could only think that of
      you it would explain everything, and I should know just how to treat you.
      But I do not think it of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a long, deep sigh Yvonne crept closer and laid her head against
      Lydia's shoulder. The girl's body stiffened, her brow grew dark with
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you do not understand, Mrs Brood. The fact still remains that
      you have not considered Frederic's peace of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor yours,&rdquo; murmured the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor mine,&rdquo; confessed Lydia, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that you and Frederic were in love with each other until I
      had been here for some time,&rdquo; Mrs Brood explained, suddenly fretful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia stared hard at the soft white cheek that lay exposed below the black
      crown of hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had that to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal more than you can imagine,&rdquo; said the other, looking up into
      Lydia's face with a curious gleam in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit, then, that you deliberately&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit nothing, except that I am sorry to have made you unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a woman are you?&rdquo; burst out Lydia's indignant soul. &ldquo;Have
      you no conception of the finer, nobler&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne deliberately put her hand over the girl's lips, checking the fierce
      outburst. She smiled rather plaintively as Lydia tried to jerk her head to
      one side in order to continue her reckless indictment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not say it, Lydia. I am not all that you think I am. No, no; a
      thousand times no. God pity me, I am more accursed than you may think with
      the finer and nobler instincts. If it were not so, do you think I should
      be where I am now&mdash;cringing here like a beaten child? No, you cannot
      understand&mdash;you never will understand. I shall say no more. It is
      ended. I swear on my soul that I did not know you were Frederic's
      sweetheart. I did not know&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you knew almost immediately after you came here!&rdquo; exclaimed Lydia
      harshly. &ldquo;It is not myself I am thinking of, Mrs Brood, but of Frederic.
      Why have you done this abominable thing to him? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I did not realise what it would mean to him,&rdquo; said the other
      desperately. &ldquo;I&mdash;I did not count all the cost. But, dearest Lydia, it
      will come out all right. Everything shall be made right again, I promise
      you. I have made a horrible, horrible mistake. I can say no more. Now let
      me lie here with my head upon your breast. I want to feel the beating of
      your pure, honest heart&mdash;the heart I have hurt. I can tell by its
      throbs whether it will ever soften toward me. Do not say anything now&mdash;let
      us be still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to describe the feelings of
      Lydia Desmond as she sat there with the despised, though to be adored,
      head pillowed upon her breast, where it now rested in a sort of confident
      repose, as if there was safety in the very strength of the young girl's
      disapproval. Yvonne had twisted her lithe body on the <i>chaise longue</i>
      so that she half faced Lydia. Her free arm, from which the loose sleeve
      had fallen, leaving it bare to the shoulder, was about the girl's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Lydia stared straight before her, seeing nothing,
      positively dumb with wonder, and acknowledging a sense of dismay over her
      own disposition to submit to this extraordinary situation. She was asking
      herself why she did not cast the woman away, why she lacked the power to
      resent by deed as well as by thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she lowered her eyes, conquered by an impulse she had resisted for
      many minutes. Her now perplexed gaze rested upon the gleaming white arm,
      and then moved wonderingly to the smooth cheek and throat. She saw the
      pulse beating in that slender neck. Fascinated, she watched it for a long,
      long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there ran through her heart a strange wave of tenderness. That
      faint, delicate throb in the throat of this woman represented the rush of
      life's blood&mdash;the warm, sweet flood of a lovely living thing.
      Yvonne's eyes were closed. The long, dark lashes lay feathery above the
      alabaster cheek; there were delicate blue lines in the lids. A faint,
      almost imperceptible depression as of pain appeared between the eyebrows.
      The black, glossy hair filled Lydia's nostrils with its living perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life&mdash;marvellous, adorable life rested there on her breast. This
      woman had hurt her&mdash;had hurt her wantonly&mdash;and yet there came
      stealing over her, subtly, the conviction that she could never hurt her in
      return. She could never bring herself to the point of hurting this
      wondrous living, breathing, throbbing creature who pleaded, not only with
      her lips and eyes, but with the gentle heart-beats that rose and
      fell in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like velvet was the smooth, glossy skin of her arm and breast. Never had
      Lydia dreamed that flesh could be so soft and white and so aglow with
      vitality. There was a sheen to it, a soft sheen that seemed fairly to
      radiate light itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still in a maze of wonder and something bordering on sheer delight, she
      fell to studying the perfections that the cheek and lips revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarlet, pensively drooping were the lips, and almost opalescent the
      clear-cut cheek and chin. The delicate nostrils vibrated with the
      quickened breath that stirred the firm, full breast which rose and fell
      softly, gently; there were firm, hitherto invisible blue lines in the
      gleaming skin. Slowly, resistlessly Lydia's arm tightened about the
      slender, seductive body.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long time, in which there was conflict, she suddenly pressed her
      warm lips to Yvonne's in a kiss that thrilled through every nerve in her
      body&mdash;a kiss that lingered because it was returned with equal fervour
      and abandon. They were clasped tightly in each other's arms and their eyes
      were closed as with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in an abrupt revulsion of feeling, in a desperate awakening, Lydia
      relaxed. Her arms fell away from the warm, sweet body and her eyes widened
      with something that passed for confusion, but which was in reality shame.
      Almost roughly she pushed Yvonne away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't mean to do that!&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other withdrew her arm and straightened up slowly, all the time
      regarding the girl with a strange, wondering look in her eyes&mdash;a look
      that quickly resolved itself into sadness so poignant that the girl, even
      in her confused state of mind, recognised it as such and was abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that you would,&rdquo; said Yvonne in a very low voice, and shook her
      head drearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; murmured Lydia in great distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled, but it was a sad, plaintive effort on her part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that you would,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia sprang to her feet, her face suddenly flaming with embarrassment.
      She felt unaccountably guilty of&mdash;she knew not what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see Mr Brood. I stepped in to tell him that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       she began, trying to cover her confusion, but Yvonne interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you could not help it, my dear,&rdquo; she said. Then, after a
      pause: &ldquo;You will let me know what my husband has to say about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To&mdash;to say about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your decision to marry Frederic in spite of his objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia felt a little shiver race over her as she looked toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will help us?&rdquo; she said tremulously, turning to Yvonne. Again she saw
      the drawn, pained look about the dark eyes and was startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do more with him than I,&rdquo; was the response.
    </p>

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ydia stopped for a
      moment in the hall, after closing the door behind her, to pull herself
      together for the ordeal that was still to come. She was trembling; a
      weakness had assailed her. She had left Yvonne's presence in a dazed,
      unsettled condition of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a lapse of some kind that she could neither account for nor
      describe even to herself. She tried to put it into seconds and minutes,
      and then realised that it was not a matter to be reckoned as time. Yet
      there had been a distinct, unmistakable gap in her existence. Something
      had stopped&mdash;she knew not for how long&mdash;and then she had found
      herself breathing, thinking once more. In spite of the conviction that she
      had passed through a period of utter oblivion, she could account for every
      second of time with an absolute clearness of memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not an instant, nor a sensation, nor an impulse that was not
      fully recorded in her alert brain. She remembered everything; she could
      have described every emotion; and yet she felt that there had been a
      period of complete absence, as real as it was improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt now as she always felt after sipping champagne&mdash;in a warm
      glow of intoxication. She was drunk with the scent that filled her
      nostrils, the scent that lay on her lips, that lived and breathed with
      her. Her heart was throbbing rapidly, as if earnestly seeking to regain
      the beats that it had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there came to her an impulse to go back and lay bare before
      Yvonne all of the wretched story that had fallen from the lips of James
      Brood the night before. She conceived the strange notion that Yvonne alone
      could avert the disaster, that she could be depended upon to save Frederic
      from the blow that seemed so sure to fall. She even went so far as to turn
      toward the door and to take a step in its direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the revolt against the impulse. Was it fair to Frederic? Had she
      the right to reveal this ugly thing to one whose sympathies might, after
      all, be opposed to the wife who had preceded her in James Brood's
      affections&mdash;the wife who had been first in his heart, and whose
      memory, for all she knew, might still be a worthy adversary even in this
      day of apparent supremacy?
    </p>
    <p>
      What right had she to conclude that this woman would take up the cause of
      Frederic's mother and jeopardise her own position by seeking to put her
      husband in the wrong in that unhappy affair of long ago? Would Yvonne do
      this for Frederic? Would she do all this for Frederic's mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia turned away and went slowly toward the stairs, despising herself for
      the thought. The black velvet coat that formed a part of her trig suit
      hung limply in her hand, dragging along the floor as she moved with
      hesitating steps in the direction of James Brood's study. A sickening
      estimate of her own strength of purpose confronted her. She was suddenly
      afraid of the man who had always been her friend. Somehow she felt that he
      would turn upon and rend her, this man who had always been gentle and
      considerate&mdash;and who had killed things!
    </p>
    <p>
      She found herself at last standing stock-still at the bottom of the
      steps, looking upward, trying to concentrate all of her determination on
      what now appeared to her to be an undertaking of the utmost daring, as one
      who risks everything in an encounter in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranjab appeared at the head of the stairs. She waited for his signal to
      ascend, somehow feeling that Brood had sent him forth to summon her. Her
      hand sought the stair-rail and gripped it tightly. Her lips parted
      in a stiff smile. Now she knew that she was turning coward, that she
      longed to put off the meeting until to-morrow&mdash;<i>to-morrow!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hindu came down the stairs, quickly, noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The master say to come to-morrow, to-morrow as usual,&rdquo; he said, as he
      paused above her on the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it must be to-day,&rdquo; she said doggedly, even as the chill of
      relief shot through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said the man. His eyes were kindly inquiring. &ldquo;<i>Sahib</i>
      say you are to rest.&rdquo; There was a pause. &ldquo;To-morrow will not be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started. Had he read the thought that was in her mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Ranjab,&rdquo; she said, after a moment of indecision. &ldquo;I will come
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she slunk downstairs and out of the house, convinced that she had
      failed Frederic in his hour of greatest need, that to-morrow would be too
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic did not come in for dinner until after his father and Yvonne had
      gone from the house. He did not inquire for them, but instructed Jones to
      say to the old gentlemen that he would be pleased to dine with them if
      they could allow him the time to &ldquo;change.&rdquo; He also told Jones to open a
      single bottle of champagne and to place three glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, Mrs Brood has given strict orders&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Jones. She won't mind for to-night. We expect to drink
      the health of the bride, Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, <i>my</i> bride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bride, Mr Frederic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem! I should 'ave said, 'God be praised,' sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I think of it, don't mention it to Mr Dawes and Mr Riggs. Let me
      make the announcement, Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir. It is most confidential, of course. Bless my&mdash;I mean
      to say, Golden Seal, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any old thing, Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I offer my congratulations, Mr Frederic? Thank you, sir. Ahem! Aw&mdash;ahem!
      Anyways soon, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon, Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless&mdash;very good, sir. Of course, if I may be so bold as to inquire,
      sir, it's&mdash;it's&mdash;ahem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Jones. Who else could it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, sir, it <i>couldn't</i> be anyone else. Thank you, sir. Yes,
      sir. She is the finest young lady in this 'ere world, Mr Frederic. You did
      say Golden Seal, Cliquot, ninety-eight, sir? It's the best in the 'ouse,
      sir, quite the best at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later on Frederic made his announcement to the old men. In the fever of an
      excitement that caused him to forget that Lydia might be entitled to some
      voice in the matter, he deliberately committed her to the project that had
      become a fixed thing in his mind the instant he set foot in the house and
      found it empty&mdash;oh, so empty!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones's practised hand shook slightly as he poured the wine. The old men
      drank rather noisily. They, too, were excited. Mr Riggs smacked his lips
      and squinted at the chandelier, as if trying to decide upon the vintage,
      but in reality doing his best to keep from coughing up the wine that had
      gone the wrong way in a moment of profound paralysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best news I've heard since Judas died,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes manfully. &ldquo;Fill
      'em up again, Jones. I want to propose the health of Mrs Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The future Mrs Brood,&rdquo; hissed Mr Riggs wheezily, glaring at his comrade.
      &ldquo;Ass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not married yet, Mr Dawes,&rdquo; explained Frederic, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makes no difference,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes stoutly. &ldquo;Far as I'm concerned, you
      are. We'll be the first to drink to Lydia Brood! The first to call her by
      that name, gentlemen. God bless her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless her!&rdquo; shouted Mr Riggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless her!&rdquo; echoed Frederic, and they drained their glasses to Lydia
      Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jones, open another bottle,&rdquo; commanded Mr Dawes loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic shook his head, and two faces fell. Right bravely, however, the
      old men maintained a joyous interest in the occasion. They expounded
      loudly upon the virtues and graces of John Desmond's daughter; they plied
      the young man with questions and harangued him with advice; they
      threatened him with hell-fire if he ever gave the girl a minute of
      unhappiness; they were very firm in their contention that he &ldquo;oughtn't to
      let the grass grow under his feet,&rdquo; not for an instant! In the end they
      waxed tearful. It was quite too much joy to be borne with equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man turned moody, thoughtful; the unwonted exhilaration died as
      suddenly as it had come into existence. A shadow crossed his vision and he
      followed it with his thoughts. The gabbling of the old men irritated him
      as the makeshift feast of celebration grew old, and he made no pretence of
      keeping up his end of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gloomy, uneasy look deepened in his face. It was a farce, after all,
      this attempt to glorify an impulse conceived in desperation. A sense of
      utter loneliness came over him with a swiftness that sickened, nauseated
      him. The food was flat to his taste; he could not eat. Self-commiseration
      stifled him. He suddenly realised that he had never been so lonely, so
      unhappy, in all his life as he was at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts were of his father. A vast, inexplicable longing possessed
      his soul&mdash;a longing for the affection of this man who was never
      tender, who stood afar off and was lonely, too. He could not understand
      this astounding change of feeling. He had never felt just this way before.
      There had been times&mdash;and many&mdash;when his heart was sore with
      longing, but they were of other days, childhood days. To-night he could
      not crush out the thought of how ineffably happy, how peaceful life would
      be if his father were to lay his hands upon his shoulders and say: &ldquo;My
      son, I love you&mdash;I love you dearly.&rdquo; There would be no more lonely
      days; all that was bitter in his life would be swept away in the twinkling
      of an eye; the world would be full of joy for him and for Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anyone had told him an hour earlier that he would have been possessed
      of such emotions as these he could have sneered in the face of him. When
      he entered the house that evening he was full of resentment toward his
      father and sullen with the remains of an ugly rage. And now to be actually
      craving the affection of the man who humbled him, even in the presence of
      servants. It was unbelievable. He could not understand himself. A
      wonderful, compelling tenderness filled his heart. He longed to throw
      himself at his father's feet and crave his pardon for the harsh, vengeful
      thoughts he had spent upon him in those black hours. He hungered for a
      word of kindness or of understanding on which he could feed his starving
      soul. He wanted his father's love. He wanted, more than anything else in
      the world, to love his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia slipped out of his mind, Yvonne was set aside in that immortal
      moment. He had not thought of them except in their relation to a completed
      state of happiness for his father. Indistinctly he recognised them as
      essentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the library, later on, he smoked with the old men, moodily staring up
      through the blue clouds into a space that seemed limitless. The expression
      of pain, and the self-pity that attended it, increased in his eyes. The
      old men rambled on, but he scarcely heard them. They wrangled, and he was
      not impatient with them. He was lonely. He felt deserted, forsaken. The
      sweet companionship of the day just closing stood for naught in this hour
      of a deeper longing. He wanted to hear his father say, from his heart:
      &ldquo;Frederic, my son, here is my hand. It is no longer against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aye, he was lonely. The house was as bleak as the steppes of Siberia. He
      longed for companionship, friendship, kindness, and suddenly in the midst
      of it all he leaped to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going out, gentlemen,&rdquo; he exclaimed, breaking in upon an
      unappreciated tale that Mr Riggs was relating at some length and with
      considerable fierceness in view of the fact that Mr Dawes had pulled him
      up rather sharply once or twice in a matter of inaccuracies. &ldquo;Excuse me,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left them gaping with astonishment and dashed out into the hall for his
      coat and hat. Even then he had no definite notion as to what his next move
      would be, save that he was going out&mdash;somewhere, anywhere; he did not
      care. All the time he was employed in getting into his light overcoat his
      eyes were fixed on the front door, and in his heart was the strange,
      indescribable hope that it would open to admit his father, who, thinking
      of him in his loneliness and moved by a suddenly aroused feeling of love,
      had abandoned an evening of selfish pleasure in order to spend it with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if his father should walk in, with eagerness in his long unfriendly
      eyes, what joy it would be for him to rush up to him and cry out: &ldquo;Father,
      let's be happy! Let's make each other happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, as he rushed down the front steps with the cool night air blowing
      in his face, there surged up within him a strong, overpowering sense of
      filial duty. It was his duty to make the first advances. It was for him to
      pave the way to peace and happiness. Something vague but disturbing
      tormented him with the fear that his father faced a great peril and that
      his own place was beside him and not against him, as he had been for all
      these illy directed years. He could not put it away from him, this thought
      that his father was in danger&mdash;in danger of something that was not
      physical, something from which, with all his valour, he had no adequate
      form of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner he paused, checked by an irresistible impulse to look
      backward at the house he had just left. To his surprise there was a light
      in the drawing-room windows facing the street. The shade in one of them
      had been thrown wide open and a stream of light flared out across the
      sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing in this stream of light was the figure of a man. Slowly, as if
      drawn by a force he could not resist, the young man retraced his steps
      until he stood directly in front of the window. A questioning smile was on
      his lips. He was looking up into Ranjab's shadowy, unsmiling face, dimly
      visible in the glow from the distant street-lamp. For a long time they
      stared at each other, no sign of recognition passing between them. The
      Hindu's face was as rigid, as emotionless as if carved out of stone; his
      eyes were unwavering. Frederic could see them, even in the shadows. He had
      the queer feeling that, though the man gave no sign, he had something he
      wanted to say to him, that he was actually calling to him to come back
      into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undecided, the man outside took several halting steps toward the doorway,
      his gaze still fixed on the face in the window. Then he broke the spell.
      It was a notion on his part, he argued, If he had been wanted, his
      father's servant would have beckoned to him. He would not have stood there
      like a graven image, staring out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having convinced himself of this, Frederic wheeled and swung off up the
      street once more, walking rapidly, as one who is pursued. Turning, he
      waved his hand at the man in the window. He received no response. Farther
      off, he looked back once more. The Hindu still was there. Long after he
      was out of sight of the house he cast frequent glances over his shoulder,
      as if still expecting to see the lighted window and its occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blocks away, in his hurried, aimless flight, he slackened his pace and
      began to wonder whither he was going. He had no objective point in mind.
      He was drifting. His footsteps lagged and he looked about him for marks of
      locality. Union Square lay behind him, and beyond, across Eighteenth
      Street, was the Third Avenue Elevated. He had not meant to come in this
      direction. It was not his mind alone that wandered.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he made his way back to Broadway, somewhat hazily bent on following
      that thoroughfare up to the district where the night glittered and the
      stars were shamed, he began turning over in his mind a queer notion that
      had just suggested itself to him, filtering through the maze of
      uncertainty in which he had been floundering. It occurred to him that he
      had been mawkishly sentimental in respect to his father. He was seriously
      impressed by the feelings that had mastered him, but he found himself
      ridiculing the idea that his father stood in peril of any description. And
      suddenly, out of no particular trend of thought, groped the sly,
      persistent suspicion that he had not been altogether responsible for the
      sensations of an hour ago. Some outside influence had moulded his
      emotions, some cunning brain had been doing his thinking for him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the sharp recollection of that motionless, commanding figure in
      the lighted window, and his own puzzling behaviour on the side-walk
      outside. He recalled his impression that someone has called out to him
      just before he turned to look up at the window. It was all quite
      preposterous, he kept on saying over and over again to himself, and yet he
      could not shake off the uncanny feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a shot there flashed into his brain the startling question: was
      Ranjab the solution? Was it Ranjab's mind and not his own that had moved
      him to such tender resolves? Could such a condition be possible? Was there
      such a thing as mind control?
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed aloud, and was startled by the sound of his own voice. The idea
      was preposterous! Such a thing could not have been possible. They were his
      own thoughts, his own emotions, coming from his own brain, his own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Frederic approached the box-office of the theatre mentioned
      by Yvonne over the telephone that morning. The play was half over and the
      house was sold out. He bought a ticket of admission, however, and lined up
      with others who were content to stand at the back to witness the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had walked past the theatre three or four times before finally making
      up his mind to enter, and even then his intentions were not quite clear.
      He only knew that he was consciously committing an act that he was ashamed
      of, an act so inexcusable that his face burned as he thought of the
      struggle he had had with himself up to the moment he stood at the
      box-office window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the theatre he leaned weakly against the railing at the back of the
      auditorium and wiped his brow. What was it that had dragged him there
      against his will, in direct opposition to his dogged determination to shun
      the place? The curtain was up, the house was still, save for the
      occasional coughing of those who succumb to a habit that can neither be
      helped nor explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were people moving on the stage, but Frederic had no eyes for them.
      He was seeking in the darkness for the two figures that he knew were
      somewhere in the big, tense throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hundreds of backs confronted him, no faces. A sensation not far removed
      from stealth took possession of him. His searching eyes were furtive in
      their quest. If he had been lonely before, he was doubly so now. The very
      presence of the multitude filled him with a sickening sense of emptiness.
      He was friendless there, with all those contented backs for company. Not
      one among them all had a thought for him, not one turned so much as an
      inch from the engrossing scene that held them in its grip. Straight,
      immovable, unresponsive backs&mdash;nothing but backs!
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he asked of himself, why was he there? And he pitied himself so
      vastly that his throat contracted as with pain. His soul sickened. The
      truth was being revealed to him as he stood there and with aching eyes
      searched throughout the serried rows of backs. It came home to him all of
      a sudden that his quest was a gleaming white back and a small, exquisitely
      poised head crowned with black.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sharp execration, a word of disgust for himself, he tore himself
      away from the railing and rushed toward the doors. At the same instant a
      tremendous burst of applause filled the house and he whirled just in time
      to see the curtain descending. Curiously interested, he paused near the
      door, his gaze fixed on the great velvet wall that rose and fell at least
      a half-dozen times in response to the clamour of the delighted crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backs all at once seemed to become animated and friendly. He drew near
      the last row of seats again and stared at the actor and the actress who
      came out to take the &ldquo;curtain-call&rdquo;&mdash;stared as if at something he had
      never seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they had been up there all the time, developing the splendid climax
      that had drawn people out of their seats, that had put life into all those
      insufferable backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights went up and the house was bright. Men began scurrying up the
      aisles. Here and there broad, black backs rose up in the centre of
      sections and moved tortuously toward the aisles. Pretty soon, when the
      theatre was dark again and the curtain up, they would return, politely
      hiss something about being sorry or &ldquo;Don't get up, please,&rdquo; and even more
      tortuously move into their places, completing once more the sullen,
      arrogant row of backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic experienced a sudden shock of dismay. It was not at all unlikely
      that his father would be among those heading for the lobby, although the
      chance was remote. His father was the peculiar type of gentleman, now
      almost extinct, that subsists without fresh air quite as long as the lady
      who sits in the seat beside him. He was a bit old-fashioned for a New
      Yorker, no doubt, but he was rather distinguished for his good manners. In
      fact, he was almost unique. He would not leave Yvonne between the acts,
      Frederic was quite sure. In spite of this, the young man discreetly hid
      himself behind two stalwart figures and watched the aisles with alert,
      shifty eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the exodus was over and the danger past. He moved up to the
      railing again and resumed his eager scrutiny of the throng. He could not
      find them. At first he was conscious of disappointment, then he gave way
      to an absurd rage. Yvonne had misled him, she had deceived him&mdash;aye,
      she had <i>lied</i> to him. They were not in the audience, they had not
      even contemplated coming to this theatre. He had been tricked,
      deliberately tricked.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt they were seated in some other place of amusement, serenely
      enjoying themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of it maddened him. And then, just as he was on the point of
      tearing out of the house, he saw them, and the blood rushed to his head so
      violently that he was almost blinded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught sight of his father far down in front, and then the dark,
      half-obscured head of Yvonne. He could not see their faces, but there was
      no mistaking them for anyone else. He only marvelled that he had not seen
      them before, even in the semi-darkness. They now appeared to be the only
      people in the theatre; he could see no one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Brood's fine, aristocratic head was turned slightly toward his wife,
      who, as Frederic observed after changing his position to one of better
      advantage, apparently was relating something amusing to him. They
      undoubtedly were enjoying themselves. Once more the great, almost
      suffocating wave of tenderness for his father swept over him, mysteriously
      as before and as convincing. He experienced a sudden, inexplicable feeling
      of pity for the strong, virile man who had never revealed the slightest
      symptoms of pity for him. The same curious desire to put his hands on his
      father's shoulders and tell him that all was well with them came over him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily he glanced over his shoulder, and the fear was in his heart
      that somewhere in the shifting throng his gaze would light upon the face
      of Ranjab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long and intently his searching gaze went through the crowd, seeking the
      remote corners and shadows of the foyer, and a deep breath of relief
      escaped him when it became evident that the Hindu was not there. He had,
      in a measure, proved his own cause; his emotions were genuinely his own
      and not the outgrowth of an influence for good exercised over him by the
      Brahmin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began what he was pleased to term a systematic analysis of his emotions
      covering the entire evening, all the while regarding the couple in the
      orchestra chairs with a gaze unswerving in its fidelity to the sensation
      that now controlled him&mdash;a sensation of impending peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he slunk farther back into the shadow, a guilty flush mounting
      to his cheek. Yvonne had turned and was staring rather fixedly in his
      direction. Despite the knowledge that he was quite completely concealed by
      the intervening group of loungers, he sustained a distinct shock. He had
      the uncanny feeling that she was looking directly into his eyes. She had
      turned abruptly, as if someone had called out to attract her attention and
      she had obeyed the sudden impulse. A moment later her calmly impersonal
      gaze swept on, taking the sections to her right and the balcony, and then
      went back to her husband's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic was many minutes in recovering from the effects of the queer
      shock he had received. He could not get it out of his head that she knew
      he was there, that she actually turned in answer to the call of his mind.
      She had not searched for him; on the contrary, she directed her gaze
      instantly to the spot where he stood concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actuated by a certain sense of guilt, he decided to leave the theatre as
      soon as the curtain went up on the next act, which was to be the last.
      Instead of doing so, however, he lingered to the end of the play, secure
      in his conscienceless espionage. It had come to him that if he met them in
      front of the theatre as they came out he could invite them to join him at
      supper in one of the near-by restaurants. The idea pleased him. He coddled
      it until it became a sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When James Brood and his wife reached the side-walk they found him there,
      directly in their path as they wedged their way to the curb to await the
      automobile. He was smiling frankly, wistfully. There was an honest
      gladness in his fine, boyish face and an eager light in his eyes. He no
      longer had the sense of guilt in his soul. It had been a passing qualm,
      and he felt regenerated for having experienced it, even so briefly.
      Somehow it had purged his soul of the one longing doubt as to the
      sincerity of his impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said, planting himself squarely in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary tableau. He was vividly aware of the fact that
      Yvonne had shrunk back in alarm and that a swift look of fear leaped into
      her surprised eyes. She drew closer to Brood's side&mdash;or was it the
      jostling of the crowd that made it seem to be so? He realised then that
      she had not seen him in the theatre. Her surprise was genuine. It was not
      much short of consternation, a fact that he realised with a sudden sinking
      of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his eyes went quickly to his father's face. James Brood was regarding
      him with a cold, significant smile, as one who understands and despises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me you were here,&rdquo; faltered Frederic, the words rushing
      hurriedly through his lips, &ldquo;and I thought we might run in somewhere and
      have a bite to eat. I&mdash;I want to tell you about Lydia and myself and
      what&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage-man bawled a number in his ear and jerked open the door of a
      limousine that had pulled up to the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word James Brood handed his wife into the car and then turned to
      the chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; he said, and, without so much as a glance at Frederic, stepped
      inside. The door was slammed and the car slid out into the maelstrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne had sunk back into a corner, huddled down as if suddenly deprived
      of all her strength. Frederic saw her face as the car moved away. She was
      staring at him with wide-open, reproachful eyes, as if to say: &ldquo;Oh, what
      have you done? What a fool you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second or two he stood as if
      petrified, then everything turned red before him, a wicked red that
      blinded him. He staggered, as if from a blow in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; slipped from his stiff lips, and tears leaped to his eyes&mdash;tears
      of supreme mortification. Like a beaten dog he slunk away, feeling himself
      pierced by the pitying gaze of every mortal in the street.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ong past midnight
      the telephone in the Desmond apartment rang sharply, insistently. Lydia,
      who had just fallen asleep, awoke with a start and sat bolt upright in her
      bed. A clammy perspiration broke out all over her body. There in the
      darkness she shivered with a dread so desolating that every vestige of
      strength forsook her and she could only stare helplessly into the black
      pall that surrounded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before in all her life had she been aroused from sleep by the
      jangling of a telephone-bell. The sound struck terror to her heart. She
      knew that something terrible had happened. She knew there had been a
      catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there chattering until she heard her mother's door open and then
      the click of the receiver as it was lifted from the hook. Then she put her
      fingers to her ears and closed her eyes. The very worst had happened; she
      was sure of it. The blow had fallen. The one thought that seared her brain
      was that she had failed him, failed him miserably in the crisis. Oh, if
      she could only reclaim that lost hour of indecision and cowardice!
    </p>
    <p>
      The light in the hallway suddenly smote her in the face, and she realised
      for the first time that her eyes were tightly closed, as if to shut out
      some abhorrent sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lydia!&rdquo; Her mother was standing in the open door. &ldquo;Oh, you are awake?&rdquo;
       Mrs Desmond stared in amazement at the girl's figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, mother? Tell me what has happened? Is he&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to speak to you. He is on the wire. His voice sounds queer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl sprang out of bed and hurried to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go away, mother&mdash;stay here,&rdquo; she cried as she sped past the
      white-clad figure in the doorway. Mrs Desmond flattened herself against
      the wall and remained there as motionless as a statue, her sombre gaze
      fixed on her daughter's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Frederic, it is I, Lydia. What is it, dear?&rdquo; Her voice was high and
      thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      His words came jerking over the wire, sharp and querulous. She closed her
      eyes in anticipation of the blow, her body rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to disturb you,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;but I just had to call you
      up.&rdquo; The words were disjointed, as if he forced them from his lips in a
      supreme effort at coherency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;it's all right. I don't mind. You did right. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to release me from my promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Release you? Oh, Freddy!&rdquo; It was a wail that issued from her lips. Her
      body sagged limply, she steadied herself by leaning against the wall for
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to, Lydia. There's no other way. Something has happened
      to-night, dear. You've got to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he&mdash;has he&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her throat closed up as if
      gripped by a strong hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to drag you out of bed to tell you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddy, Freddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you that I must withdraw my promise, even if you refuse to
      release me. Oh, I'm not excited, I'm not crazy, I'm not drunk! I never was
      so steady in my life. To-night has made a man of me. I know just where I
      stand at last. Now go back to bed, dearest, and don't worry about
      anything. I couldn't go ahead until I'd asked you to release me from the
      promise I made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;the promise&mdash;but, Freddy, I can't release you. I love
      you. I <i>will</i> be your wife, no matter what has happened, no matter&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, Lyddy&mdash;it isn't that! It's the other&mdash;the promise to
      say nothing to my father&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she sighed weakly, a vast wave of relief almost suffocating her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has made it impossible for me to go on without&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you, Frederic?&rdquo; she cried in sudden alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm all right. I shan't go home, you may be sure of that. To-morrow
      will be time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you? I must know. How can I reach you by telephone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be frightened, dear. It's got to be, that's all. It might as well
      be ended now as later on. The last straw was laid on to-night. Now don't
      ask questions. I'll see you in the morning. Good night, sweetheart. I've&mdash;I've
      told you that I can't stick to my promise. You'll understand. I couldn't
      rest until I'd told you and heard your dear voice. Forgive me for calling
      you up. Tell your mother I'm sorry. Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddy, listen to me! You must wait until I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Oh!&rdquo; He
      had hung up the receiver. She heard the whir of the open wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little comfort for her in the hope held out by her mother as
      they sat far into the night and discussed the possibilities of the day so
      near at hand. She could see nothing but disaster, and she could think of
      nothing but her own lamentable weakness in shrinking from the encounter
      that might have made the present situation impossible. Between them mother
      and daughter constructed at random a dozen theories as to the nature of
      the fresh complication that had entered into the already serious
      situation, and always it was Lydia who advanced the most sickening of
      conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it an easy matter for Mrs Desmond to combat these fears. In her
      heart she felt that an irreparable break had occurred and that the final
      clash was imminent. She tried to make light of the situation, however,
      prophesying a calmer attitude for Frederic after he had slept over his
      grievance, which, after all, she argued was doubtless exaggerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She promised to go with Lydia to see James Brood in the morning, and to
      plead with him to be merciful to the boy she was to marry, no matter what
      transpired. The girl at first insisted on going over to see him that
      night, notwithstanding the hour, and was dissuaded only after the most
      earnest opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was four o'clock before they went back to bed, and long after five
      before either closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Desmond, utterly exhausted, was the first to awake. She glanced at the
      little clock on her dressing-table and gave a great start of
      consternation. It was long past nine o'clock. She arose at once and
      hurried to her daughter's door, half expecting to find the room empty and
      the girl missing from the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lydia was lying there sound asleep. Mrs Desmond's lips parted to give
      voice to a gentle call, but it was never uttered. A feeling of infinite
      pity for the tired, harassed girl came over her. For a long time she stood
      there watching the gentle rise and fall of the sleeper's breast. Then she
      closed the door softly and stole back to her own room, inspired by a
      sudden resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was dressing the little maid-servant brought in her coffee and
      toast and received instructions not to awaken Miss Lydia but to let her
      have her sleep out. A few minutes later she left the apartment and walked
      briskly around the corner to Brood's home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had resolved to take the matter out of her daughter's hands. As she
      stood at the bedroom door watching Lydia's sweet, troubled face, there
      arose within her the mother instinct to fight for her young. It was not
      unlikely that James Brood could be moved by Lydia's pleading, in spite of
      his declaration that Frederic should never marry her, but the mother
      recognised the falseness of a position gained by such means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over Lydia's head would hang the perpetual reminder that he had submitted
      out of consideration for her, and not through fairness or justice to
      Frederic; all the rest of her life she would be made to feel that he
      tolerated Frederic for her sake. The girl would never know a moment in
      which she could be free from that ugly sense of obligation. God willing,
      Frederic would be her daughter's husband. Lydia might spare him the blow
      that James Brood could deal, but all of her life would be spent in
      contemplation of that one bitter hour in which she went on her knees to
      beg for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother saw all this with a foresightedness that stripped the situation
      of every vestige of romance. Lydia might rejoice at the outset, but there
      would surely come a time of heartache for her. It would come with the full
      realisation that James Brood's pity was hard to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearing that she might be too late, she walked so rapidly that she was
      quite out of breath when she entered the house. Mr Riggs and Mr Dawes were
      putting on their coats in the hall preparatory to their short morning
      constitutional. They greeted her profusely, and with one accord proceeded
      to divest themselves of the coats, announcing in one voice their intention
      to remain for a good, old-fashioned chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's dear of you,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, &ldquo;but I must see Mr Brood at once.
      Why not come over to my apartment this afternoon for a cup of tea and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood's voice interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, Mrs Desmond?&rdquo; came from the landing above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor looked up with a start, not so much of surprise as uneasiness.
      There was something sharp, unfriendly, in the low, level tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne, fully dressed&mdash;a most unusual circumstance at that hour of
      the day&mdash;was leaning over the banister-rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to see Mr Brood on a very important&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is occupied. Won't I do as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really quite serious, Mrs Brood. I am afraid it would be of no
      avail to&mdash;to take it up with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been sent here by someone else?&rdquo; demanded Mrs Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen Frederic,&rdquo; fell from the other's lips before she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you haven't,&rdquo; said the other with ominous clearness. &ldquo;He has
      been here since seven this morning, waiting for a chance to speak to his
      father in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven help me! I&mdash;I am too&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless he spent the night in your apartment, I fancy you haven't seen
      him,&rdquo; went on Yvonne languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was descending the stairs slowly, almost lazily as she uttered the
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are together now?&rdquo; gasped Mrs Desmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come into the library? Good morning, gentlemen. I trust you may
      enjoy your long walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Desmond followed her into the library. Yvonne closed the door almost
      in the face of Mr Riggs, who had opened his mouth to accept the invitation
      to tea, but who said he'd &ldquo;be blasted&rdquo; instead, so narrow was his escape
      from having his nose banged. He emphasised the declaration by shaking his
      fist at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women faced each other. For the first time since she had known
      Yvonne Brood, Mrs Desmond observed a high touch of colour in her cheeks.
      Her beautiful eyes were alive with an excitement she could not conceal.
      Neither spoke for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are accountable for this, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; said Lydia Desmond's mother
      sternly, accusingly. She expected a storm of indignant protest. Instead,
      Yvonne smiled slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not hurt my husband to discover that Frederic is a man and not a
      milksop,&rdquo; she said, but despite her coolness there was a perceptible note
      of anxiety in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, then, that they are&mdash;that they will quarrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy it was in Frederic's mind to do so when he came here this
      morning. He was still in his evening clothes, Mrs Desmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he has them on,&rdquo; said Yvonne lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Desmond regarded her for a moment in perplexity. Then her eyes flashed
      dangerously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you misunderstood me, Mrs Brood. Where are Frederic and
      his father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not accustomed to that tone of voice, Mrs Desmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no longer your housekeeper,&rdquo; said the other succinctly. &ldquo;You do not
      realise what this quarrel may mean. I insist on going up to them before it
      has gone too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband can take care of himself, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not thinking of your husband, but of that poor boy who is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I am to judge by Frederic's manner this morning, he is also able
      to take care of himself,&rdquo; said Yvonne coolly. Her voice shook a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Desmond shot a quick glance of comprehension at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are worried, Mrs Brood. Your manner betrays you. I command you to
      tell me how long they have been upstairs together. How long&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be so good, Mrs Desmond, as to leave this house instantly?&rdquo;
       cried Yvonne angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other quietly. &ldquo;I suppose I am too late to prevent trouble
      between those two men, but I shall at least remain here to assure Frederic
      of my sympathy, to help him if I can, to offer him the shelter of my
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A spasm of alarm crossed Yvonne's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really believe it will come to that?&rdquo; she demanded nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what I fear should come to pass, he will not stay in this house
      another hour. He will go forth from it cursing James Brood with all the
      hatred that his soul can possess. And now, Mrs Brood, shall I tell you
      what I think of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It isn't at all necessary. Besides, I've changed my mind. I'd like
      you to remain. I do not want to mystify you any farther, Mrs Desmond, but
      I now confess to you that I am losing my courage. Don't ask me to tell you
      why, but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is the custom with those who play with fire. They shrink
      when it burns them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood looked at her steadily. The rebellious, sullen expression died
      out of her eyes. She sighed deeply, almost despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry you think ill of me, but yet I cannot blame you for
      considering me to be a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; I'll not say it. Mrs
      Desmond, I&mdash;I wish I had never come to this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to echo your words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never be able to understand me. And, after all, why should I
      care? You are nothing to me. You are merely a good woman who has no real
      object in life. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No real object in life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Sit down. We will wait here together, if you please. I&mdash;I
      <i>am</i> worried. I think I rather like to feel that you are here with
      me. You see, the crisis has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, of course, that he turned one wife out of this house, Mrs
      Brood,&rdquo; said Mrs Desmond deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like terror leaped into the other's eyes. The watcher
      experienced an incomprehensible feeling of pity for her&mdash;she who had
      been despising her so fiercely the instant before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he will not turn me out,&rdquo; murmured Yvonne, and suddenly began
      pacing the floor, her hands clenched. Stopping abruptly in front of the
      other woman, she exclaimed: &ldquo;He made a great mistake in driving that other
      woman out. He is not likely to repeat it, Mrs Desmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think he <i>did</i> make a mistake,&rdquo; said Mrs Desmond calmly.
      &ldquo;But he does not think so. He is a man of iron. He is unbending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a wonderful man&mdash;a great, splendid man,&rdquo; cried Yvonne
      fiercely. &ldquo;It is I&mdash;Yvonne Lestrange&mdash;who proclaim it to the
      world. I cannot bear to see him suffer. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why do you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you would say it, eh? Well, there is no answer. Poof! Perhaps it will
      not be so bad as we think. Come! I am no longer uneasy. See! I am very
      calm. Am I not an example for you? Sit down. We will wait together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat far apart, each filled with dark misgivings, though radically
      opposed in their manner of treating the situation. Mrs Desmond was cold
      with apprehension. She sat immovable, tense. Yvonne sank back easily in a
      deep, comfortable chair and coolly lighted a cigarette. It would have been
      remarked by a keen observer that her failure to offer one to her visitor
      was evidence of an unwonted abstraction. As a matter of fact, inwardly she
      was trembling like a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is nothing to do,&rdquo; said Mrs Desmond in despair, after a
      long silence. &ldquo;Poor Lydia will never forgive herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne blew rings of smoke toward the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you think I am an evil person, Mrs Desmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curiously, Mrs Brood, I have never thought of you in that light. Your
      transgressions are the greater for that reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Transgressions? An amiable word, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come here, however, to discuss your actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne leaned forward suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not ask what transpired last night to bring about this crisis. Why
      do you hesitate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Desmond shook her head slowly. &ldquo;I do not want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was not what you have been thinking it was,&rdquo; said Yvonne
      levelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am relieved to hear it,&rdquo; said the other rather grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood flushed to the roots of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want to appear unfair to my husband, but I declare to you, Mrs
      Desmond, that Frederic is fully justified in the attitude he has taken
      this morning. His father humiliated him last night in a manner that made
      forbearance impossible. That much I must say for Frederic. And permit me
      to add, from my soul, that he is vastly more sinned against than sinning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can readily believe that, Mrs Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning Frederic came into the breakfast-room while we were having
      our coffee. You look surprised. Yes, I was having breakfast with my
      husband. I knew that Frederic would come. That was my reason. When I heard
      him in the hall I sent the servants out of the dining-room. He had spent
      the night with a friend. His first words on entering the room were these&mdash;I
      shall never forget them: 'Last night I thought I loved you, father, but I
      have come home just to tell you that I hate you. I can't stay in this
      house another day. I'm going to get out. But I just wanted you to know
      that I thought I loved you last night, as a son should love his father. I
      just wanted you to know it.'
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not even look at me, Mrs Desmond. I don't believe he knew I was
      there. I shall never forget the look in James Brood's face. It was as if
      he saw a ghost or some horrible thing that fascinated him. He did not
      utter a word, but stared at Frederic in that terrible, awe-struck way.
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm going to get out,' said Frederic, his voice rising. 'You've treated
      me like a dog all of my life, and I'm through. I shan't even say good-bye
      to you. You don't deserve any more consideration from me than I've
      received from you. I hope I'll never see you again. If I ever have a son
      I'll not treat him as you've treated your son. You don't deserve the
      honour of being called father; you don't deserve to have a son. I wish to
      God I had never been obliged to call you father! I don't know what you did
      to my mother, but if you treated her as&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just then my husband found his voice. He sprang to his feet, and I've
      never seen such a look of rage. I thought he was going to strike Frederic,
      and I think I screamed&mdash;just a little scream, of course. I was so
      terrified. But he only said&mdash;and it was horrible the way he said
      it&mdash;'You fool&mdash;you bastard!' And Frederic laughed in his face and cried out,
      unafraid: 'I'm glad you call me a bastard! I'd rather be one than be your
      son. It would at least give me something to be proud of&mdash;a real father!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; fell from Mrs Desmond's white lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne seemed to have paused to catch her breath. Her breast heaved
      convulsively, the grip of her hands tightened on the arms of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she resumed her recital, but her voice was hoarse and tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was terribly frightened. I thought of calling out to Jones, but I&mdash;I
      had no voice! Ah, you have never seen two angry men waiting to spring at
      each other's throats, Mrs Desmond. My husband suddenly regained control of
      himself. He was very calm. 'Come with me,' he said to Frederic. 'This is
      not the place to wash our filthy family linen. You say you want something
      to be proud of. Well, you shall have your wish. Come to my study.' And
      they went away together, neither speaking a word to me&mdash;they did not
      even glance in my direction. They went up the stairs. I heard the door
      close behind them&mdash;away up there. That was half an hour ago. I have
      been waiting, too&mdash;waiting as you are waiting now&mdash;to comfort
      Frederic when he comes out of that room a wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Desmond started up, an incredulous look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are taking his side? You are against your husband? Oh, now I know the
      kind of woman you are. I know&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace! You do not know the kind of woman I am. You will never know. Yes,
      I shall take sides with Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not love your husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange, unfathomable smile came into Yvonne's face and stayed there.
      Mrs Desmond experienced the same odd feeling she had had years ago on
      first seeing the Sphinx. She was suddenly confronted by an unsolvable
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall not drive me out of his house, Mrs Desmond,&rdquo; was her answer to
      the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A door slammed in the upper regions of the house. Both women started to
      their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over,&rdquo; breathed Yvonne with a tremulous sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see how well they were able to take care of themselves, Mrs
      Brood,&rdquo; said Mrs Desmond in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said the other mechanically. Suddenly she turned
      on the tall, accusing figure beside her. &ldquo;Go away! Go now! I command you
      to go. This is <i>our</i> affair, Mrs Desmond. You are not needed here.
      You were too late, as you say. I beg of you, go!&rdquo; She strode swiftly
      toward the door. As she was about to place her hand on the knob it was
      opened from the other side, and Ranjab stood before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sahib</i> begs to be excused, Mrs Desmond. He is just going out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going out?&rdquo; cried Yvonne, who had shrunk back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>sahibah</i>. You will please excuse, Mrs Desmond. He regret very
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Desmond passed slowly through the door, which he held open for her. As
      she passed by the Hindu she looked full into his dark, expressive eyes,
      and there was a question in hers. He did not speak, but she read the
      answer as if it were on a printed page. Her shoulders drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to Lydia.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen James Brood
      and Frederic left the dining-room, nearly an hour prior to the departure of
      Mrs Desmond, there was in the mind of each the resolution to make short
      work of the coming interview. Each knew that the time had arrived for the
      parting of the ways, and neither had the least desire to prolong the
      suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic, far from suspecting the ordeal in store for him, experienced a
      curious sense of exaltation as he followed the master of the house up the
      stairway. He was about to declare his freedom; the very thought of it
      thrilled him. He had at last found the courage to revolt, and there was
      cause for rejoicing in the prospect of a lively triumph over what he was
      pleased to call oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not mince matters! Oh, no; he would come straight to the point.
      There wasn't any sense in temporising. There were years of pent-up
      grievances that he could fling at his father, but he would crystallise
      them into a few withering minutes and have done with the business. He knew
      he was as pale as a ghost and his legs were strangely weak, but he was not
      cognisant of the slightest sensation of fear, nor the least inclination to
      shrink from the consequences of that brief, original challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study door was closed. James Brood put his hand on the knob, but
      before turning it faced the young man with an odd mixture of anger and
      pity in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it will be better if we had nothing more to say to each other,&rdquo;
       he said with an effort.
      &ldquo;I have changed my mind. I cannot say the thing to you that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it got anything to do with Yvonne and me?&rdquo; demanded Frederic
      ruthlessly, jumping at conclusions in his new-found arrogance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood threw open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step inside,&rdquo; he said in a voice that should have warned the younger man,
      it was so prophetic of disaster. Frederic had touched the open sore with
      that unhappy question. Not until this instant had James Brood admitted to
      himself that there was a sore and that it had been festering all these
      weeks. Now it was laid bare and it smarted with pain. Nothing could save
      Frederic after that reckless, deliberate thrust at the very core of the
      malignant growth that lay so near the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been in James Brood's heart to spare the boy. An unaccountable wave
      of compassion had swept through him as he mounted the stairs, leading his
      victim to the sacrifice. He would have allowed him to go his way in
      ignorance of the evil truth; he would have spared the son of Matilde and
      been happier, far happier, he knew, for having done so. He would have let
      him fare forth, as he elected to go, rejoicing in his foolish
      independence, scorning to the end of his days, perhaps, the man who posed
      as father to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Frederic had touched the hateful sore. His chance was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hot words were on Frederic's lips. Brood held up his hand, and there was
      in the gesture a command that silenced the young man. He was somewhat
      shocked to find that he still recognised the other's right to command. The
      older man went quickly to the door of the Hindu's closet. He rapped on the
      panel, and in an instant the door was opened. Ranjab stepped out and
      quickly closed the door behind him. A few words, spoken in lowered tones
      and in the language of the East, passed between master and man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic turned his back to them. Moved by a sudden impulse, he strode to
      the window and pulled the curtains apart. A swift glance upward showed him
      the drawn shades in Lydia's bedroom windows. Somehow he was glad that she
      was asleep. An impulse as strong as the other ordered him to shift his
      glance downward to the little balcony outside of Yvonne's windows. Then he
      heard the door close softly behind him and turned to face his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were alone in the room. He squared his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you think I am in love with her,&rdquo; he said defiantly. He waited
      a moment for the response that did not come. Brood was regarding him with
      eyes from which every spark of compassion had disappeared. &ldquo;Well, it may
      interest you to know that I intend to marry Lydia this very day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood advanced a few steps toward him. In the subdued light of the room
      his features were not clearly distinguishable. His face was gray and
      shadowy; only the eyes were sharply defined. They glowed like points of
      light, unflickering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be sorry for Lydia,&rdquo; he said levelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't be,&rdquo; said Frederic hotly. &ldquo;She understands everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were born to be dishonest in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my purpose to tell you precisely what I mean. Lydia understands far
      more than you think. If she marries you it will be with her eyes open; she
      will have no one to blame but herself for the mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I haven't tried to deceive her as to my prospects. She knows how poor
      we will be at the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know that this love you profess for her is at the very outset
      disloyal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frederic was silent for a moment. A twinge shot through his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She understands everything,&rdquo; he repeated stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you lied to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lied? You'd better be careful how you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you told her that you love her and no one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you <i>have</i> lied to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence&mdash;tense silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect me to strike you for that?&rdquo; came at last from Frederic's
      lips, low and menacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have always considered yourself to be my son, haven't you?&rdquo; pursued
      Brood deliberately. &ldquo;Can you say to me that you have behaved of late as a
      son should&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! We'll settle that point right now. I <i>did</i> lose my head. Head,
      I say, not heart. I shan't attempt to explain&mdash;I can't, for that
      matter. As for Yvonne&mdash;well, she's as good as gold. She understands
      me far better than I understand myself. She knows that even honest men
      lose their heads sometimes&mdash;and she knows the difference between love
      and&mdash;the other thing. I can say to you now that I would sooner have
      cut my own throat than do more than envy you the possession of someone you
      do not deserve. I <i>have</i> considered myself your son. I have no
      apology to make for my&mdash;we'll call it infatuation. I shall only admit
      that it has existed and that I have despaired. So God is my witness, I
      have never loved anyone but Lydia. I have given her pain, and the amazing
      part of it is that I can't help myself. Naturally, you can't understand
      what it all means. You are not a young man any longer. You cannot
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; burst from Brood's lips. Then he laughed aloud&mdash;grotesquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne is the most wonderful thing that has ever come into my life. She
      has shown me that life is beautiful and rich and full of warmth. I had
      always thought it ugly and cold. Something inside of me awoke the instant
      I looked into her eyes&mdash;something that had always been there, and yet
      undeveloped. She spoke to me with her eyes, if you can believe such a
      thing possible, and I understood. I adored her the instant I saw her. I
      have felt sometimes that I knew her a thousand years ago. I have felt that
      I loved her a thousand years ago.&rdquo; A calm seriousness now attended his
      speech, in direct contrast to the violent mood that had gone before. &ldquo;I
      have thought of little else but her. I confess it to you. But through it
      all there has never been an instant in which I did not worship Lydia
      Desmond. I&mdash;I do not pretend to account for it. It is beyond me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood waited patiently to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother before you had a somewhat similar affliction,&rdquo; he said, still
      in the steady, repressed voice. &ldquo;Perhaps it is a gift&mdash;a convenient
      gift&mdash;this ability to worship without effort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better leave my mother out of it,&rdquo; said Frederic sarcastically. A look of
      wonder leaped to his eyes. &ldquo;That's the first time you've condescended to
      acknowledge that I ever had a mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall soon make you regret that you were ever so blessed as to have had
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've always made it easy for me to regret that I ever had a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood's smile was deadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have anything more to say to me, you had better get it over. Purge
      your soul of all the gall that embitters it. I grant you that privilege.
      Take your innings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A spasm of pain crossed Frederic's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am entitled to my innings. I'll go back to what I said downstairs.
      I thought I loved and honoured you last night. I would have forgiven
      everything if you had granted me a friendly&mdash;friendly, that's all&mdash;just
      a friendly word. You denied&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you want me to believe that it was love for me that brought you
      slinking to the theatre,&rdquo; said the other ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't expect you to believe anything. I was lonely. I wanted to be with
      you and Yvonne. Curse you! Can't you understand how lonely I've been all
      my life? Can't you understand how hungry I am for the affection that every
      other boy I've known has had from his parents? I've never asked you about
      my mother. I used to wonder a good deal. Every other boy had a mother. I
      never had one. I couldn't understand it. And they all had fathers, but
      they were not like my father. Their fathers were kind and loving, they
      were interested in everything their sons did&mdash;good or bad. I used to
      love the fathers of all those other lucky boys at school. They came often&mdash;and
      so did the mothers. No one ever came to see me&mdash;no one!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to wonder why you never told me of my own mother. Long ago I gave
      up wondering. Something warned me not to ask you about her. Something told
      me it was best to let sleeping dogs lie. I never inquired of anyone after
      I was old enough to think for myself. I was afraid to ask, so I waited,
      hoping all the time that you would some day tell me of her. But you've
      never breathed her name to me. I no longer wonder. I know now that she
      must have hated you with all the strength of her soul. God, how she must
      have hated to feel the touch of your hands upon her body! Something tells
      me she left you, and if she did, I hope she afterward found someone who&mdash;but
      no, I won't say it. Even now I haven't the heart to hurt you by saying
      that.&rdquo; He stopped, choking up with the rush of bitter words. &ldquo;Well, why
      don't you say something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm giving you your innings. Go on,&rdquo; said Brood softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have loved you once&mdash;or she wouldn't have married you. She
      must have loved you or I wouldn't be here in this world. She&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; came sharply from Brood.
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;didn't find you out until it was
      too late. She was lovely, I know. She was sweet and gentle and she loved
      happiness. I can see that in her face, in her big, wistful eyes. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; demanded Brood, startled. &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've got her portrait&mdash;an old photograph. For a month I've
      carried it here in this pocket-case over my heart. I wouldn't part
      with it for all the money in the world. When I look at the dear, sweet,
      girlish face and her eyes look back into mine, I know that <i>she</i>
      loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her portrait?&rdquo; said Brood, unbelieving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and I have only to look at it to know that she couldn't have
      hurt you&mdash;so it must have been the other way round. She's dead now, I
      know, but she didn't die for years after I was born. Why was it that I
      never saw her? Why was I kept up there in that damnable village&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get that photograph?&rdquo; demanded Brood hoarsely. &ldquo;Where, I
      say? What interfering fool&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be too nasty, if I were you,&rdquo; said Frederic, a note of triumph
      in his voice. &ldquo;Yvonne gave it to me. I made her promise to say nothing to
      you about it. She&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne? Are you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Impossible! She could not have had&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was lying under the marble top of that old bureau in her bedroom. She
      found it there when the men came to take it away to storage. It hadn't
      been moved in twenty years or more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In&mdash;her&mdash;bedroom?&rdquo; murmured Brood, passing his hand over his
      eyes. &ldquo;The old bureau&mdash;marble top&mdash;good Lord! It was our
      bedroom. Let me see it&mdash;give it to me this instant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do that. It's mine now. It's safe where it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne found it? Yvonne? And gave it to you? What damnable trick of fate
      is this? But&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Ah, it may not be a portrait of your&mdash;your
      mother. Some old photograph that got stuck under the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is my mother. Yvonne saw the resemblance at once and brought it to
      me. And it may interest you to know that she advised me to treasure it all
      my life, because it would always tell me how lovely and sweet my mother
      was&mdash;the mother I have never seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist on seeing that picture,&rdquo; said Brood with deadly intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Frederic, folding his arms tightly across his breast. &ldquo;You
      didn't deserve her then and you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you are saying, boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don't I? Well, I've got just a little bit of my mother safe here over
      my heart&mdash;a little faded card, that's all&mdash;and you shall not rob
      me of that. I wish to God I had her here, just as she was when she had the
      picture taken. Don't glare at me like that. I don't intend to give it up.
      Last night I was sorry for you. I had the feeling that somehow you have
      always been unhappy over something that happened in the past, and that my
      mother was responsible. And yet when I took out this photograph, this tiny
      bit of old cardboard&mdash;see, it is so small that it can be carried in
      my waistcoat pocket&mdash;when I took it out and looked at the pure,
      lovely face, I&mdash;by Heaven, I knew she was not to blame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you finished?&rdquo; asked Brood, wiping his brow. It was dripping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except to repeat that I am through with you for ever. I've had all that I
      can endure, and I'm through. My greatest regret is that I didn't get out
      long ago. But like a fool&mdash;a weak fool&mdash;I kept on hoping that
      you'd change and that there were better days ahead for me. I kept on
      hoping that you'd be a real father to me. Good Lord, what a libel on the
      name!&rdquo; He laughed raucously. &ldquo;I'm sick of calling you father. You did me
      the honour downstairs of calling me 'bastard.' You had no right to call me
      that; but, by Heaven, if it were not for this bit of cardboard here over
      my heart, I'd laugh in your face and be happy to shout from the housetops
      that I am no son of yours. But there's no such luck as that! I've only to
      look at my mother's innocent, soulful face to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; shouted Brood in an awful voice. His clenched hands were raised
      above his head. &ldquo;The time has come for me to tell you the truth about this
      innocent mother of yours. Luck is with you. I am not your father. You are&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! If you are going to tell me that my mother was not a good woman, I
      want to go on record in advance of anything you may say, as being glad
      that I am her son no matter who my father was. I am glad that she loved me
      because I was her child, and if you are not my father, then I still have
      the joy of knowing that she loved some one man well enough to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He broke off the bitter sentence and with nervous fingers drew a small
      leather case from his waistcoat pocket. &ldquo;Before you go any farther, take
      one look at her face. It will make you ashamed of yourself. Can you stand
      there and lie about her after looking into&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was holding the window curtains apart, and a stream of light fell upon
      the lovely face, so small that Brood was obliged to come quite close to be
      able to see it. His eyes were distended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not Matilde&mdash;it is like her, but&mdash;yes, yes; it is
      Matilde! I must be losing my mind to have thought&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      wiped his brow. &ldquo;But it was startling&mdash;positively uncanny.&rdquo; He spoke
      as to himself, apparently forgetting that he had a listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, can you lie about her now?&rdquo; demanded Frederic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood was still staring, as if fascinated, at the tiny photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have never seen that picture before. She never had one so small as
      that. It&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was made in Vienna,&rdquo; interrupted Frederic, not without a strange
      thrill of satisfaction in his soul, &ldquo;and before you were married, I'd say.
      On the back of it is written 'To my own sweetheart,' in Hungarian, Yvonne
      says. There! Look at her. She was like that when you married her. How
      adorable she must have been. 'To my own sweetheart'! O&mdash;ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hoarse cry of rage and pain burst from Brood's lips. The world grew red
      before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To my own sweetheart'!&rdquo; he cried out. He sprang forward and struck the
      photograph from Frederic's hand. It fell to the floor at his feet. Before
      the young man could recover from his surprise, Brood's foot was upon the
      bit of cardboard. &ldquo;Don't raise your hand to me! Don't you dare to strike
      me! Now I shall tell you who that sweetheart was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later James Brood descended the stairs alone. He went
      straight to the library, where he knew that he could find Yvonne. Ranjab,
      standing in the hall, peered into his white, drawn face as he passed, and
      started forward as if to speak to him. But Brood did not see him. He did
      not lift his gaze from the floor. The Hindu went swiftly up the stairs, a
      deep dread in his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shades were down. Brood stopped inside the door and looked dully about
      the library. He was on the point of retiring when Yvonne spoke to him out
      of the shadowy corner beyond the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close the door,&rdquo; she said huskily. Then she emerged slowly, almost like a
      spectre, from the dark background formed by the huge mahogany bookcases
      that lined the walls from floor to ceiling. &ldquo;You were a long time up
      there,&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it so dark in here, Yvonne?&rdquo; he asked lifelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that it would not be possible for me to see the shame in your eyes,
      James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned heavily against the long table. She came up and stood across the
      table from him, and he felt that her eyes were searching his very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have hurt him beyond all chance of recovery,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you struck him down? He&mdash;he is dying?&rdquo; Her voice trailed
      off into a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be a long time in dying. It will be slow. I struck him down, not
      with my hand, not with a weapon that he could parry, but with words&mdash;words!
      Do you hear? I have crushed his soul with words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you coward!&rdquo; she cried, leaning over the table, her eyes blazing. &ldquo;I
      can understand it in you. You have no soul of your own. What have you done
      to your son, James Brood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew back as if from the impact of a blow. &ldquo;Coward? If I have crushed
      his soul, it was done in time, Yvonne, to deprive you of the glory of
      doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say to you about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had your fears for nothing. He did not put you in jeopardy,&rdquo; he
      said scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. He is not a coward,&rdquo; she said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your heart you are reviling me. You judge me as one guilty soul judges
      another. Suppose that I were to confess to you that I left him up there
      with all the hope, all the life blasted out of his eyes&mdash;with a wound
      in his heart that will never stop bleeding&mdash;that I left him because I
      was sorry for what I had done and could not stand by and look upon the
      wreck I had created. Suppose&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am still thinking of you as a coward. What is it to me that you are
      sorry now? What have you done to that wretched, unhappy boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will tell you soon enough. Then you will despise me even more than I
      despise myself. He&mdash;he looked at me with his mother's eyes when I kept on
      striking blows at his very soul. Her eyes&mdash;eyes that were always pleading
      with me! But, curse them&mdash;always scoffing at me! For a moment I
      faltered. There was a wave of love&mdash;yes, love, not pity, for him&mdash;as
      I saw him go down before the words I hurled at him. It was as if I had
      hurt the only thing in all the world that I love. Then it passed. He was
      not meant for me to love. He was born for me to despise. He was born to
      torture me as I have tortured him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor fool!&rdquo; she cried, her eyes glittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I have doubted my own reason,&rdquo; he went on, as if he had not
      heard her scathing remark. &ldquo;Sometimes I have felt a queer gripping of the
      heart when I was harshest toward him. Sometimes, his eyes&mdash;<i>her eyes</i>&mdash;have
      melted the steel that was driven into my heart long ago, his voice and the
      touch of his hand have gently checked my bitterest thoughts. Are you
      listening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask what I have done to him. It is nothing in comparison to what he
      would have done to me. It isn't necessary to explain. You know the thing
      he has had in his heart to do. I have known it from the beginning. It is
      the treacherous heart of his mother that propels that boy's blood along
      its craven way. She was an evil thing&mdash;as evil as God ever put life
      into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved her as no woman was ever loved before&mdash;or since. I thought she
      loved me; I believe she did. He&mdash;Frederic had her portrait up there
      to flash in my face. She was beautiful; she was as lovely as&mdash;but no
      more! I was not the man. She loved another. You may have guessed, as
      others have guessed, that she betrayed me. Her lover was that boy's
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dead silence reigned in the room, save for the heavy breathing of the man.
      Yvonne was as still as death itself. Her hands were clenched against her
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was years ago,&rdquo; resumed the man hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you told him this?&rdquo; she cried, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stood before me up there and said that he hoped he might some day
      discover that he was not my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him <i>then?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cursed me for having driven his mother out of my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He uttered the hope that she might come back from the grave to torture me
      for ever&mdash;to pay me back for what I had done to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you told him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said she must have loathed me as no man was ever loathed before. Then
      I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him because you knew she did <i>not</i> loathe you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne! You are laughing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laugh because after he had said all these bitter things to you, and you
      had paid him back by telling him that he was not your son, it was you&mdash;not
      he&mdash;who was sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not expect sympathy from you, but&mdash;to have you laugh in my
      face! I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you expect sympathy from him?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him in the end that as he was not my son he need feel no
      compunction in trying to steal my wife away from me. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he say to that?&rdquo; she broke in shrilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! He did not speak to me after that. Not one word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor should I speak to you again, James Brood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne&mdash;I&mdash;I love you. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you loved Matilde&mdash;God pity your poor soul! For no more than I
      have done, you drove her out of your house. You accuse me in your heart
      when you vent your rage on that poor boy. Oh, I know! You suspect <i>me!</i>
      And you suspected the other one. I swear to you that you have more cause
      to suspect me than Matilde. She was not untrue to you. She could not have
      loved anyone else but you. I know&mdash;I know! Don't come near me! Not
      now! I tell you that Frederic is your son. I tell you that Matilde loved
      no one but you. You drove her out. You drive Frederic out. <i>And you will
      drive me out!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood over him like an accusing angel, her arms extended. He shrank
      back, glaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say these things to me? You cannot know&mdash;you have no
      right to say&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> sorry for you, James Brood,&rdquo; she murmured, suddenly relaxing.
      Her body swayed against the table, and then she sank limply into the chair
      alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never forget that you struck a man who was asleep, absolutely
      asleep, James Brood. That's why I am sorry for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep!&rdquo; he murmured, putting his hand to his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;he
      was asleep! Yvonne, I&mdash;I have never been so near to loving him as I
      am now. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going up to him. Don't try to stop me. But first let me ask you a
      question. What did Frederic say when you told him his mother was was what
      you claim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood lowered his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that I was a cowardly liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was then that you began to feel that you loved him. Ah, I see what
      it is that you need, James. You are a great, strong man, a wonderful man
      in spite of all this. You have a heart&mdash;a heart that still needs
      breaking before you can ever hope to be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if my heart hasn't already been broken,&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your head has been hurt, that's all. There is a vast difference. Are you
      going out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in dull amazement. Slowly he began to pull himself
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I think you should go to him. I&mdash;I gave him an hour to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He must go, you see. See him, if you will. I shall not oppose you.
      Find out what he expects to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed swiftly by him as he started toward the door. In the hall,
      which was bright with the sunlight from the upper windows, she turned to
      face him. To his astonishment her cheeks were aglow and her eyes bright
      with eagerness. She seemed almost radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it needs breaking, James,&rdquo; she said, and went up the stairs, leaving
      him standing there dumbfounded. Near the top she began to hum a blithe
      tune. It came down to him distinctly&mdash;the weird little air that had
      haunted him for years&mdash;Feverelli's!

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o Brood's surprise
      she came half-way down the steps again, and, leaning over the
      railing, spoke to him with a voice full of irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be good enough to call off your spy, James?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; He had started to put on his light overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you know,&rdquo; she said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you consider me so mean, so infamous as&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began
      hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I feel happier when I know he is out of the house. Call off
      your dog, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smothered an execration and then called out harshly to Jones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Ranjab to attend me here, Jones. He is to go out with me,&rdquo; he said to
      the butler a moment later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne was still leaning over the banister, a scornful smile on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wait until you are gone. I intend to see Frederic alone,&rdquo; she
      said, with marked emphasis on the final word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; said he coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the upper hall and disappeared from view down the corridor
      leading to her own room. Her lips were set with decision; a wild, reckless
      light filled her eyes, and the smile of scorn had given way to one of
      exaltation. Her breath came fast and tremulously through quivering
      nostrils as she closed her door and hurried across to the little
      vine-covered balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time has come&mdash;the time has come, thank God!&rdquo; she was saying to
      herself, over and over again. The French doors stuck. She was jerking
      angrily at them when her maid hurried in from the bedroom, attracted by
      the unusual commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Que faites vous, madame?</i>&rdquo; she cried anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mistress turned quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! Go downstairs at once and tell them that I have dismissed you. At
      once, do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oui madame!</i>&rdquo; cried Céleste, her eyes dancing with a sudden,
      incomprehensible delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to leave the house immediately. I dismiss you. You have been
      stealing from me, do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oui, madame. Je comprendes parfaitement, madame!</i>&rdquo; cried the maid,
      actually clapping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will pack two steamer-trunks and get them out of the house before
      five o'clock. You are going back to Paris. You are dismissed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little Frenchwoman beamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Certainement, madame! Par le premier bateau. Je comprend</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first boat for Havre&mdash;do you know the hour for sailing? Consult
      the morning paper, Céleste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>En bien, madame. La Provence. Il part demain. Je&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go at once!&rdquo; cried the mistress, waving her hands excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Vous me renvoyez!</i>&rdquo; And the little maid dashed out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she descended the back stairs an amazing change came over her. Her
      sprightly face became black with sullen rage and her eyes snapped with
      fury. So violent was her manner when she accosted Jones in the servants'
      hall that he fell back in some alarm. She was not long in making him
      understand that she had been dismissed, however, and that she would surely
      poison the diabolical creature upstairs if she remained in the house
      another hour. Even the cook, who had a temper of her own, was appalled by
      the exhibition; other servants were struck dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones, perspiring freely, said something about calling in an officer, and
      then Céleste began to weep bitterly. All she wanted was to get out of the
      house before she did something desperate to the cruel tyrant upstairs, and
      she'd be eternally grateful to Jones if he'd get her trunks out of the
      storeroom as soon as&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; But Jones was already on his way
      to give instructions to the furnace-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Céleste took the occasion to go into hysterics, and the entire servant
      body fell to work hissing &ldquo;<i>Sh&mdash;h!</i>&rdquo; in an agony of apprehension
      lest the turmoil should penetrate the walls and reach the ears of the
      &ldquo;woman upstairs.&rdquo; They closed all of the doors and most of the windows,
      and the upstairs maid thought it would be a good idea to put a blanket
      over the girl's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Yvonne turned her attention to the window across the court and
      two floors above her the heavily curtained window in Brood's &ldquo;retreat.&rdquo;
       There was no sign of life there, so she hurried to the front of the house
      to wait for the departure of James Brood and his man. The two were going
      down the front steps. At the bottom Brood spoke to Ranjab, and the latter,
      as imperturbable as a rock, bowed low and moved off in an opposite
      direction to that taken by his master. She watched until both were out of
      sight. Then she rapidly mounted the stairs to the top floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic was lying on the couch near the jade room door. She was able to
      distinguish his long, dark figure after peering intently about the shadowy
      interior in what seemed at first to be a vain search for him. She shrank
      back, her eyes fixed in horror upon the prostrate shadow. Suddenly he
      stirred and then half raised himself on one elbow to stare at the figure
      in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it <i>you?</i>&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, and dropped back with a great
      sigh on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart leaped. The blood rushed back to her face. Quickly closing the
      door, she advanced into the room, her tread as swift and as soft as a
      cat's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone out. We are quite alone,&rdquo; she said, stopping to lean against
      the table, suddenly faint with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, a bitter, mirthless, snarling laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up, Frederic. Be a man! I know what has happened. Get up! I want to
      talk it over with you. We must plan. We must decide now at once&mdash;before
      he returns.&rdquo; The words broke from her lips with sharp, staccato-like
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to a sitting posture slowly, all the while staring at her with a
      dull wonder in his heavy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull yourself together,&rdquo; she cried hurriedly. &ldquo;We cannot talk here. I am
      afraid in this room. It has ears, I know. That awful Hindu is always here,
      even though he may seem to be elsewhere. We will go down to my boudoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slowly shook his head and then allowed his chin to sink dejectedly into
      his hands. With his elbows resting on his knees, he watched her movements
      in a state of increasing interest and bewilderment. She turned abruptly to
      the Buddha, whose placid, smirking countenance seemed to be alive to the
      situation in all of its aspects. Standing close, her hands behind her
      back, her figure very erect and theatric, she proceeded to address the
      image in a voice full of mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my chatterbox friend, I have pierced his armour, haven't I? He will
      creep up here and ask you, his wonderful god, to tell him what to do about
      it, <i>aïe?</i> His wits are tangled. He doubts his senses. And when he
      comes to you, my friend, and whines his secret doubts into your excellent
      and trustworthy ear, do me the kindness to keep the secret I shall now
      whisper to you, for I trust you, too, you amiable fraud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standing on tiptoe, she put her lips to the idol's ear and whispered.
      Frederic, across the room, roused from his lethargy by the strange words
      and still stranger action, rose to his feet and took several steps toward
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! Now you know everything. You know more than James Brood knows, for
      you know what his charming wife is about to do next.&rdquo; She drew back and
      regarded the image through half-closed, smouldering eyes. &ldquo;But he will
      know before long&mdash;before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, Yvonne?&rdquo; demanded Frederic unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She whirled about and came toward him, her hands still clasped behind her
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she said, ignoring his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he thinks I am in love with you,&rdquo; said he, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you not in love with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was startled. &ldquo;Good Lord, Yvonne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came quite close to him. He could feel the warmth that travelled from
      her body across the short space that separated them. The intoxicating
      perfume filled his nostrils; he drew a deep breath, his eyes closing
      slowly as his senses prepared to succumb to the delicious spell that came
      over him. When he opened them an instant later she was still facing him,
      as straight and fearless as a soldier, and the light of victory was in her
      dark, compelling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said deliberately, &ldquo;I am ready to go away with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell back stunned beyond the power of speech. His brain was filled with
      a thousand clattering noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has turned you out,&rdquo; she went on rapidly. &ldquo;He disowns you. Very well;
      the time has come for me to exact payment of him for that and for all that
      has gone before. I shall go away with you. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he cried, finding his tongue and drawing still farther away
      from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not in love with me?&rdquo; she whispered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hands to his eyes to shut out the alluring vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, Yvonne&mdash;leave me. Let me go my way. Let me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cursed your mother! He curses you! He damns you&mdash;as he damned
      her. You can pay him up for everything. You owe nothing to him. He has
      killed every&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frederic straightened up suddenly and, with a loud cry of exultation,
      raised his clenched hands above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, I will break him! I will make him pay! Do you know what he has
      done to me? Listen to this: he boasts of having reared me to manhood, as
      one might bring up a prize beast, that he might make me pay for the wrong
      that my poor mother did a quarter of a century ago. All these years he has
      had in mind this thing that he has done to-day. All my life has been spent
      in preparation for the sacrifice that came an hour ago. I have suffered
      all these years in ignorance of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so loud!&rdquo; she whispered, alarmed by the vehemence of his reawakened
      fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not afraid!&rdquo; he cried savagely. &ldquo;Can you imagine anything more
      diabolical than the scheme he has had in mind all these years? To pay back
      my mother&mdash;whom he loved and still loves&mdash;yes, by Heaven, he
      still loves her&mdash;he works to this beastly end! He made her suffer the
      agonies of the damned up to the day of her death by refusing her the right
      to have the child that he swears is no child of his. Oh, you don't know
      the story&mdash;you don't know the kind of man you have for a husband&mdash;you
      don't&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I do know!&rdquo; she cried violently, beating her breast with
      clenched hands. &ldquo;I <i>do</i> know! I know that he still loves the poor
      girl who went out of this house with his curses ringing in her ears a
      score of years ago, and who died still hearing them. And I had almost come
      to the point of pitying him&mdash;I was failing&mdash;I was weakening. He
      is a wonderful man. I&mdash;I was losing myself. But that is all over.
      Three months ago I could have left him without a pang&mdash;yesterday I
      was afraid that it would never be possible. To-day he makes it easy for
      me. He has hurt you beyond all reason, not because he hates you, but
      because he loved your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do love him!&rdquo; cried Frederic in stark wonder. &ldquo;You don't care the
      snap of your fingers for me. What is all this you are saying, Yvonne? You
      must be mad. Think! Think what you are saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought&mdash;I am always thinking. I know my own mind well
      enough. It is settled: I am going away, and I am going with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't be in earnest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am desperately in earnest. You owe nothing to him now. He says you are
      not his son. You owe nothing but hatred to him, and you should pay. You
      owe vengeance for your mother's sake&mdash;for the sake of her whose face you
      have come to love, who loved you to the day she died, I am sure. He will
      proclaim to the world that you are not his son, he will brand you with the
      mark of shame, he will drive you out of New York. You are the son of a
      music-master, he shouts from the housetops! Your mother was a vile woman,
      he shouts from the housetops! You cannot remain here. You <i>must</i> go.
      You must take me with you. Ah, you are thinking of Lydia! Well, are you
      thinking of dragging her through the mire that he will create? Are you
      willing to give her the name he declares is not yours to give? Are you a
      craven, whipped coward who will not strike back when the chance is offered
      to give a blow that will&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot listen to you, Yvonne!&rdquo; cried Frederic, aghast. His heart was
      pounding so fiercely that the blood surged to his head in great waves,
      almost stunning him with its velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We go to-morrow!&rdquo; she cried out in an ecstasy of triumph. She was
      convinced that he would go! &ldquo;La Provence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; he gasped, dropping suddenly into a chair and burying his
      face in his shaking hands. &ldquo;What will this mean to Lydia&mdash;what will she do&mdash;what
      will become of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quiver of pain crossed the woman's face, her eyelids fell as if to shut
      out something that shamed her in spite of all her vainglorious
      protestations. Then the spirit of exaltation resumed its sway. She lifted
      her eyes heavenward, and inaudible words trembled on her lips. A moment
      later she stood over him, her hands extended as if in blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he looked up at that instant he would have witnessed a Yvonne he did
      not know. No longer was she the alluring, sensuous creature who had been
      in his thoughts for months, but a transfigured being whose soul looked out
      through gentle, pitying eyes, whose wiles no longer were employed in the
      devices of which she was past-mistress, whose real nature was revealed now
      for the first time since she entered the house of James Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was pain and suffering in the lovely eyes, and there was a strange
      atmosphere of sanctuary attending the very conquest she had made. But
      Frederic did not look up until all this had passed and the smile of
      triumph was on her lips again and the glint of determination in her eyes.
      He had missed the revelation that would have altered his estimate of her
      for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot marry Lydia now,&rdquo; she said, affecting a sharpness of tone that
      caused him to shrink involuntarily. &ldquo;It is your duty to write her a letter
      to-night, explaining all that has happened to-day. She would sacrifice
      herself for you to-day, but there is&mdash;to-morrow! A thousand
      to-morrows, Frederic. Don't forget them, my dear. They would be ugly,
      after all, and she is too good, too fine to be dragged into&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right!&rdquo; he exclaimed, leaping to his feet. &ldquo;It would be the
      vilest act that a man could perpetrate. Why&mdash;why, it would be proof
      of what he says of me&mdash;it would stamp me for ever the dastard he&mdash;no,
      no; I could never lift my head again if I were to do this utterly vile
      thing to Lydia. He said to me here&mdash;not an hour ago&mdash;that he
      expected me to go ahead and blight that loyal girl's life, that I would
      consider it a noble means of self-justification! What do you think of
      that? He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; But wait! What is this that we are proposing
      to do? Give me time to think! Why&mdash;why, I can't take you away from him,
      Yvonne! What am I thinking of? Have I no sense of honour? Am I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not his son,&rdquo; she said significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is no reason why I should stoop to a foul trick like this. Do&mdash;do
      you know what you are suggesting?&rdquo; He drew back from her with a look of
      disgust in his eyes. &ldquo;No! I'm not that vile! I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic, you must let me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to hear anything more, Yvonne. What manner of woman are you?
      He is your husband, he loves you, he trusts you; oh, yes, he does! And you
      would leave him like this? You would&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Not so loud!&rdquo; she cried in great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let me tell you something more. Although I can never marry Lydia, by
      Heaven, I shall love her to the end of my life. I will not betray that
      love. To the end of time she shall know that my love for her is real and
      true and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic, you must listen to me,&rdquo; she cried, wringing her hands. &ldquo;You
      must hear what I have to say to you. Wait! Do not leave me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Yvonne&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; he cried, pausing in utter
      amazement after taking a few steps toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she whispered, following him with dragging steps.
      &ldquo;Not to <i>him?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not! Do you think I would betray you to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Give me time to think,&rdquo; she pleaded. He shook his head resolutely.
      &ldquo;Do not judge me too harshly. Hear what I have to say before you condemn
      me. I am not the vile creature you think, Frederic. Wait! Let me think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her for a moment in deep perplexity and then slowly drew
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne, I do not believe you mean to do wrong&mdash;I do not believe it
      of you. You have been carried away by some horrible&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; she broke in fiercely. &ldquo;I would have sacrificed you&mdash;aye,
      sacrificed you, poor boy&mdash;in order to strike James Brood the
      cruellest blow that man ever sustained. I would have destroyed you in
      destroying him&mdash;God forgive me! But you have shown me how terrible I
      am, how utterly terrible! Love you? No! No! Not in that way. I would have
      put a curse, an undeserved curse, upon your innocent head, and all for the
      joy it would give me to see James Brood grovel in misery for the rest of
      his life. Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a groan of despair and self-loathing so deep and full of pain
      that his heart was chilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne!&rdquo; he gasped, dumbfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not come near me!&rdquo; she cried out, covering her face with her hands.
      For a full minute she stood before him, straight and rigid as a statue, a
      tragic figure he was never to forget. Suddenly she lowered her hands. To
      his surprise, a smile was on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would never have gone away with me. I know it now. All these months I
      have been counting on you for this very hour, this culminating hour&mdash;and
      now I realise how little hope I have really had, even from the beginning.
      You are honourable. There have been times when my influence over you was
      such that you resisted only because you were loyal to yourself&mdash;not
      to Lydia, not to my husband&mdash;but to yourself. I came to this house
      with but one purpose in mind. I came here to take you away from the man
      who has always stood as your father. I would not have become your mistress&mdash;pah!
      how loathsome it sounds!&mdash;but I would have enticed you away, believing
      myself to be justified. I would have struck James Brood that blow. He
      would have gone to his grave believing himself to have been paid in full
      by the son of the woman he had degraded, by the boy he had reared for the
      slaughter, by the blood&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God's name, Yvonne, what is this you are saying? What have you against
      my&mdash;against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! I shall come to that. I did not stop to consider all that I should
      have to overcome. First, there was your soul, your honour, your integrity
      to consider. I did not think of all those things. I did not stop to think
      of the damnable wrong I should be doing to you. I was blind to everything
      except my one great, long-enduring purpose. I could see nothing else but
      triumph over James Brood. To gain my end it was necessary that I should be
      his wife. I became his wife&mdash;I deliberately took that step in order
      to make complete my triumph over him. I became the wife of the man I had
      hated with all my soul, Frederic. So you can see how far I was willing to
      go to&mdash;ah, it was a hard thing to do! But I did not shrink. I went
      into it without faltering, without a single thought of the cost to myself.
      He was to pay for all that, too, in the end. Look into my eyes, Frederic.
      I want to ask you a question. Will you go away with me? Will you take me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned her look steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I want to hear you say. It means the end. I have done all
      that could be done, and I have failed. Thank God, I have failed!&rdquo; She came
      swiftly to him and, before he was aware of her intention, clutched his
      hand and pressed it to her lips. He was shocked to find that a sudden gush
      of tears was wetting his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Yvonne!&rdquo; he cried miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sobbing convulsively. He looked down upon her dark, bowed head and
      again felt the mastering desire to crush her slender, beautiful body in
      his arms. The spell of her was upon him again, but now he realised that
      the appeal was to his spirit and not to his flesh&mdash;as it had been all
      along, he was beginning to suspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't pity me,&rdquo; she choked out. &ldquo;This will pass, as everything else has
      passed. I am proud of you now, Frederic. You are splendid. Not many men
      could have resisted in this hour of despair. You have been cast off,
      despised, degraded, humiliated. You were offered the means to retaliate.
      You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was tempted!&rdquo; he cried bitterly. &ldquo;For the moment I was&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now what is to become of <i>me?</i>&rdquo; she wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart grew cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you will leave him? You will go back to Paris? Yvonne, it will
      be a blow to him. He has had one fearful slash in the back. This will
      break him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, I may have that consolation,&rdquo; she cried, straightening up in an
      effort to revive her waning purpose. &ldquo;Yes, I shall go. I cannot stay here
      now. I&mdash;&rdquo; She paused and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in Heaven's name, have you against my&mdash;against him? What does
      it all mean? How you must have hated him to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hated him? Oh, how feeble the word is! Hate! There should be a word that
      strikes more terror to the soul than that one. But wait! You shall know
      everything. You shall have the story from the beginning. There is much to
      tell, and there will be consolation&mdash;aye, triumph for you in the
      story I shall tell. First, let me say this to you: when I came here I did
      not know that there was a Lydia Desmond. I would have hurt that poor girl;
      but it would not have been a lasting pain. In my plans, after I came to
      know her, there grew a beautiful alternative through which she should know
      great happiness. Oh, I have planned well and carefully, but I was
      ruthless. I would have crushed her with him rather than to have failed.
      But it is all a dream that has passed, and I am awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the most cruel, but the most magnificent dream&mdash;ah, but I
      dare not think of it. As I stand here before you now, Frederic, I am shorn
      of all my power. I could not strike him as I might have done a month ago.
      Even as I was cursing him but a moment ago I realised that I could not
      have gone on with the game. Even as I begged you to take your revenge, I
      knew that it was not myself who urged, but the thing that was having its
      death-struggle within me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on. Tell me. Why do you stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was glancing fearfully toward the Hindu's door. &ldquo;There is one man in
      this house who knows. He reads my every thought. He does not know all, but
      he knows <i>me</i>. He has known from the beginning that I was not to be
      trusted. That man is never out of my thoughts. I fear him, Frederic&mdash;I
      fear him as I fear death. If he had not been here I&mdash;I believe I
      should have dared anything. I <i>could</i> have taken you away with me
      months ago. But he worked his spell and I was afraid. I faltered. He knew
      that I was afraid, for he spoke to me one day of the beautiful serpents in
      his land that were cowards in spite of the death they could deal with one
      flash of their fangs. You were intoxicated. I <i>am</i> a thing of beauty.
      I can charm as the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows that is true,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But enough of that! I am stricken with my own poison. Go to the door! See
      if he is there. I fear&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one is near,&rdquo; said he, after striding swiftly to both doors, listening
      at one and peering out through the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to go away, Frederic. I shall have to go. But we shall not
      go together. In my room I have kept hidden the sum of ten thousand
      dollars, waiting for the day to come when I should use it to complete the
      game I have played. I knew that you would have no money of your own. I was
      prepared even for that. Look again! See if anyone is there? I feel&mdash;I
      feel that someone is near us. Look, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See! There is no one near.&rdquo; He held open the door to the hall. &ldquo;You must
      speak quickly. I am to leave this house in an hour. I was given the
      hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I can see by your face that you hate him! It is well. That is
      something. It is but little, I know, after all I have wished for&mdash;but
      it is something for me to treasure&mdash;something for me to take back
      with me to the one sacred little spot in this beastly world of men and
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne, you are the most incomprehensible&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not beautiful, Frederic? Tell me!&rdquo; She came quite close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the most beautiful woman in all the world,&rdquo; he said abjectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have wasted all my beauty&mdash;I have lent it to unloveliness, and
      it has not been destroyed! It is still with me, is it not? I have not lost
      it in&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are beautiful beyond words&mdash;beyond anything I have ever
      imagined,&rdquo; said he, suddenly passing his hand over his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have loved me if it had not been for Lydia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't have helped myself. I&mdash;I fear I&mdash;faltered in my&mdash;are
      you still trying to tempt me? Are you still asking me to go away with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hoarse cry came from the doorway behind them&mdash;a cry of pain and
      anger that struck terror to their souls.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>ransfixed, they
      watched James Brood take two or three steps into the room. At his back was
      the swarthy Hindu, his eyes gleaming like coals of fire in the shadowy
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James!&rdquo; fell tremulously from the lips of Yvonne. She swayed toward him
      as Ranjab grasped his arm from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic saw the flash of something bright as it passed from the brown
      hand to the white one. He did not at once comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened once,&rdquo; came hoarsely from the throat of James Brood. &ldquo;It
      shall not happen again. Thank you, Ranjab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Frederic knew. The Hindu had slipped a revolver into his master's
      hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gives me great pleasure, Yvonne, to relieve you of that worthless
      thing you call your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he raised his arm Frederic sprang forward with a shout of horror.
      Scarcely realising what he did, he hurled Yvonne violently to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all over in the twinkling of an eye. There was a flash, the crash
      of an explosion, a puff of smoke, and the smell of burned powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic stood perfectly still for an instant, facing the soft cloud that
      rose from the pistol-barrel, an expression of vague amazement in his
      face. Then his hand went uncertainly to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already James Brood had seen the red blotch that spread with incredible
      swiftness&mdash;blood-red against the snowy white of the broad shirt
      bosom. Glaring with wide-open eyes at the horrid spot, he stood
      there with the pistol still levelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, father, you've&mdash;why, you've&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       struggled from Frederic's writhing lips, and then his knees sagged; an
      instant later they gave way with a rush and he dropped heavily to the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a sound in the room. Suddenly Brood made a movement, quick
      and spasmodic. At the same instant Ranjab flung himself forward and
      grasped his master's arm. He had turned the revolver upon himself! The
      muzzle was almost at his temple when the Hindu seized his hand in a grip
      of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sahib! Sahib!</i>&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; Wrenching the
      weapon from the stiff, unresisting fingers, he hurled it across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood groaned. His tall body swerved forward, but his legs refused to
      carry him. The Hindu caught him as he was sinking limply to his knees.
      With a tremendous effort of the will, Brood succeeded in conquering the
      black unconsciousness that was assailing him. He straightened up to his
      full height and with trembling fingers pointed to the prostrate figure on
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pistol, Ranjab! Where is it? Give it to me! Man, can I live after <i>that?</i>
      I have killed my son&mdash;my own son! Quick, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sahib!</i>&rdquo; cried the Hindu, wringing his hands. &ldquo;I cannot! I cannot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I command you! The pistol!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the Hindu, fatalist, slave, pagan that he was, turned to do
      his master's bidding. It was not for him to say nay, it was not for him to
      oppose the will of the master, but to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time Yvonne was crouching against the table, her horrified gaze
      upon the great red blotch that grew to terrible proportions as she
      watched. She had not moved, she had not breathed, she had not taken her
      hands from her ears where she had placed them at the sound of the
      explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood! It is blood!&rdquo; she moaned, and for the first time since the shot
      was fired her husband glanced at the one for whom the bullet had
      originally been intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      An expression of incredulity leaped into his face, as if he could not
      believe his senses. She was alive and unhurt! His bullet had not touched
      her. His brain fumbled for the explanation of this miracle. He had not
      aimed at Frederic, he had not fired at him, and yet he lay stretched out
      there before him, bleeding, while the one he had meant to destroy was
      living&mdash;incomprehensively living! How had it happened? What agency
      had swept his deadly bullet out of its path to find lodgment in the wrong
      heart? There was no blood gushing from her breast; he could not understand
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not take her eyes from the great red blot; she was fascinated by
      the horror that spread farther and farther across the gleaming white. She
      was alone, utterly alone with the most dreadful thing she had ever known;
      alone with that appalling thing called death. A life was leaving its warm,
      beautiful home as she watched, leaving in a path of red, creeping away
      across a stretch of white!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood!&rdquo; she wailed again, a long, shuddering word that came not from her
      lips but from the very depths of her terror-stricken soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Brood's mind worked out of the maze. His shot had gone straight,
      but Frederic himself had leaped into its path to save this miserable
      creature who would have damned his soul if life had been spared to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranjab crawled to his side, his eyes covered with one arm, the other
      extended. Blindly the master felt for the pistol, not once removing his
      eyes from the pallid figure against the table. His fingers closed upon the
      weapon. Then the Hindu looked up, warned by the strange voice that spoke
      to him from the mind of his master. He saw the arm slowly extend itself
      with a sinister hand directed straight at the figure of the woman. This
      time Brood was making sure of his aim, so sure that the lithe Hindu had
      time to spring to his feet weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master! Master!&rdquo; he cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood turned to look at his man in sheer bewilderment. What could all this
      mean? What was the matter with the fellow?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down, Ranjab!&rdquo; he commanded in a low, cautious tone, as he would have
      used in speaking to a dog when the game was run to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but one bullet left, <i>sahib!</i>&rdquo; cried the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one is required,&rdquo; said the master hazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have killed your son. This bullet is for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! But&mdash;but see! She lives! She&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Hindu struck his own breast significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy faithful servant remains, <i>sahib</i>. Die, if thou wilt, but leave
      her to Ranjab. There is but one bullet left. It is for you. You must not
      be here to witness the death Ranjab, thy servant, shall inflict upon her.
      Shoot thyself now, if so be it, but spare thyself the sight of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence, but his strong, bony fingers went through
      the motion that told a more horrible story than words could have
      expressed. There was no mistaking his meaning. He had elected himself her
      executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ghastly look of comprehension flitted across Brood's face. For a second
      his mind slipped from one dread to another more appalling. He knew this
      man of his. He remembered the story of another killing in the hills of
      India. His gaze went from the brown fanatic's face to the white, tender,
      lovely throat of the woman, and a hoarse gasp broke from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No! Not that!&rdquo; he cried, and as the words rang out Yvonne removed her
      horrified gaze from the blot of red and fixed it upon the face of her husband. She straightened up
      slowly and her arms fell limply to her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was meant for me. Shoot, James!&rdquo; she said, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hindu's grasp tightened at the convulsive movement of his master's
      hand. His fingers were like steel bands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; she repeated, raising her voice. &ldquo;Save yourself, for if he is
      dead I shall kill you with my own hands! This is your chance&mdash;shoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood's fingers relaxed their grip on the revolver. A fierce, wild hope
      took all the strength out of his body; he grew faint with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he can't be dead! I have not killed him. He shall not die, he
      shall not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flinging the Hindu aside, he threw himself down beside the body on the
      floor. The revolver, as it dropped, was caught in the nimble hand of the
      Hindu, who took two long, swift strides toward the woman who now faced him
      instead of her husband. There was a great light in his eyes as he stood
      over her, and she saw death staring upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not quail. She was past all that. She looked straight into his
      eyes for an instant and then, as if putting him out of her thoughts
      entirely, turned slowly toward the two men on the floor. The man
      half-raised the pistol, but something stayed his hand, something stronger
      than any mere physical opposition could have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glared at the half-averted face, confounded by the most extraordinary
      impression that ever had entered his incomprehensible brain. Something
      strange and wonderful was transpiring before his very eyes, something so
      marvellous that even he, mysterious seer of the Ganges, was stunned into
      complete amazement and unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      That strange, uncanny intelligence of his, born of a thousand mysteries,
      was being tried beyond all previous exactions. It was as if he now saw
      this woman for the first time, as if he had never looked upon her face
      before. A mist appeared to envelop her, and through this veil he saw a
      face that was new to him, the face of Yvonne, and yet <i>not</i> hers at
      all. Absolute wonder crept into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if impelled by the power of his gaze, she faced him once more. For what
      seemed hours to him, but in reality only seconds, his searching eyes
      looked deep into hers. He saw at last the soul of this woman, and it was
      not the soul he had known as hers up to that tremendous moment. And he
      came to know that she was no longer afraid of him or his powers. His hand
      was lowered, his eyes fell, and his lips moved; but there were no words,
      for he addressed a spirit. All the venom, all the hatred fled from his
      soul. His knee bent in sudden submission, and his eyes were raised to hers
      once more, but now in their sombre depths was the fidelity of the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go at once,&rdquo; she said, and her voice was as clear as a bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shot a swift glance at the prostrate Frederic and straightened his tall
      figure, as would a soldier under orders. His understanding gaze sought
      hers again. There was another command in her eyes. He placed the weapon on
      the table. It had been a distinct command to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of us will use it,&rdquo; she said monotonously. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With incredible swiftness he was gone. The curtains barely moved as he
      passed between them, and the heavy door made no sound in opening and
      closing. There was no one in the hall. The sound of the shot had not gone
      beyond the thick walls of that proscribed room on the top floor. Somewhere
      at the rear of the house an indistinct voice was uttering a jumbled stream
      of French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many minutes passed. There was not a sound, not a movement in the room.
      Brood, kneeling beside the outstretched figure of his unintended victim,
      was staring at the graying face with wide, unblinking eyes. He looked at
      last upon features that he had searched for in vain through all the sullen
      years. There was blood on his hands and on his cheek, for he had listened
      at first for the beat of the heart. Afterward his agonised gaze had gone
      to the bloodless face. There it was arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dumb wonder possessed his soul. He knelt there petrified by the shock of
      discovery. In the dim light he no longer saw the features of Matilde, but
      his own, and his heart was still. In that revealing moment he realised
      that he had never seen anything in Frederic's countenance save the dark,
      never-to-be-forgotten eyes, and they were his Matilde's.
      Now those eyes were closed. He could not see them, and the blindness was
      struck from his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always looked into the boy's eyes, he had never been able to seek
      farther than those haunting, inquiring eyes, but now he saw the lean,
      strong jaw and the firm chin, the straight nose and the broad forehead,
      and none of these was Matilde's. These were the features of a man, and of
      but one man. He was seeing himself as he was when he looked into his
      mirror at twenty-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these years he had been blind; all these years he had gone on cursing
      his own image. In that overpowering thought came the realisation that it
      was too late for him to atone. His mind slowly struggled out of the
      stupefied bondage of years. He was looking at his own face. Dead, he would
      look like that! Matilde was gone for ever, the eyes were closed, but he
      was there; James Brood was still there, turning grayer and grayer of face
      all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the pent-up rage of years rushed suddenly to his lips and an
      awful curse issued, but it was delivered against himself. He started to
      rise to his feet, his mind bent on the one way to end the anguish that was
      too great to bear. The revolver!
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been cruel, it should be kind. His heart leaped. He had a few
      seconds to live, not longer than it would take to find the weapon and
      place it against his breast&mdash;just so long and no longer would he be
      compelled to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten the woman. She was standing just beyond the body that
      stretched itself between them. Her hands were clasped against her breast
      and her eyes were lifted heavenward. She had not moved throughout that age
      of oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her and suddenly became rigid. Slowly he sank back, his eyes
      distended, his jaw dropping. He put out a hand and saved himself from
      falling, but his eyes did not leave the face of the woman who prayed,
      whose whole being was the material representation of prayer. But it was
      not Yvonne, his wife, that he saw standing there. It was another Matilde!
    </p>
    <p>
      A hoarse, inarticulate sound came from his gaping mouth, and then issued
      the words that his mind had created unknown to him while he knelt, but now
      were uttered in a purely physical release from the throat that had held
      them back through a period of utter unconsciousness. He never knew that he
      spoke them; they were not the words that his conscious mind was now
      framing for deliverance. He said what he had already started to say when
      his soul was full of hatred for Yvonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You foul, cringing&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then came the new
      cry&mdash;&ldquo;Matilde, Matilde! Forgive! Forgive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly her eyes were lowered until they fell full upon his stricken face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I going mad?&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. As he stared the delicate, wan
      face of Matilde began to fade and he again saw the brilliant, undimmed
      features of Yvonne. &ldquo;But it <i>was</i> Matilde! What trick of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet and advanced upon her, stepping across the body of
      his son in his reckless haste. For many seconds they stood with their
      faces close together, he staring wildly, she with a dull look of agony in
      her eyes, but unflinching. What he saw caused an icy chill to sweep
      through his tense body and a sickness to enter his soul. He shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who are you?&rdquo; he cried out in sudden terror. He felt the
      presence of Matilde. He could have stretched out his hand and touched her,
      so real, so vivid was the belief that she was actually there before him.
      &ldquo;Matilde was here&mdash;I saw her, I saw her. And&mdash;and now it is you!
      She is still here. I can feel her hand touching mine&mdash;I can feel&mdash;no,
      no! It is gone&mdash;it&mdash;has passed. She has left me again. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cold, lifeless voice of Yvonne was speaking to him, huskier than ever
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matilde <i>has</i> been here. She has always been with her son. She is
      always near you, James Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;are&mdash;you&mdash;saying?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned wearily away and pointed to the weapon on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is to use it&mdash;you or I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his mouth, but uttered no sound. His power of speech was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on in a deadly monotone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intended the bullet for me. It is not too late. Kill me, if you will.
      I give you the first chance&mdash;take it, for if you do not I shall take
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot kill you, I cannot kill the woman who stood where you
      are standing a moment ago. Matilde was there! She was alive; do you hear
      me? Alive and&mdash;ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exclamation fell from his lips as she suddenly leaned forward, her
      intense gaze fixed on Frederic's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See! Ah, see! I prayed, and I have been answered. See!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned. Frederic's eyes were open. He was looking up at them with a
      piteous appeal, an appeal for help, for life, for consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not dead! Frederic, Frederic, my son&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Brood dropped
      to his knees and frantically clutched at the hand that lay stretched
      beside the limp figure. The pain-stricken eyes closed slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne knelt beside Brood. He saw a slim, white hand go out and touch the
      pallid brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall save your soul, James Brood,&rdquo; a voice was saying, but it seemed
      far away. &ldquo;He shall not die. Your poor, wretched soul may rest secure. I
      shall keep death away from him. You shall not have to pay for this; no,
      not for this. The bullet was meant for me. I owe my life to him, you shall
      owe his to me. But you have yet to pay a greater debt than this can ever
      become. He is your son. You owe another for his life, and you will never
      be out of her debt, not even in hell, James Brood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Frederic's eyes opened again. They wavered from one face to the
      other and there was in them the unsolvable mystery of divination. As the
      lids drooped once more, Brood's manner underwent a tremendous change. The
      stupefaction of horror and doubt fell away in a flash and he was again the
      clear-headed, indomitable man of action. The blood rushed back into
      his veins, his eyes flashed with the returning fire of hope, his voice was
      steady, sharp, commanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor!&rdquo; he cried in Yvonne's ear, as his strong fingers went out to
      tear open the shirt-bosom. &ldquo;Be quick! Send for Hodder; we must save him.&rdquo;
       She did not move. He whirled upon her fiercely. &ldquo;Do as I tell you! Are you
      so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr Hodder is on the way now,&rdquo; she said dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hands ceased their operations as if checked by a sudden paralysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the way here?&rdquo; he cried incredulously. &ldquo;Why&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming,&rdquo; she said fiercely. &ldquo;I sent for him. Don't stop now, be
      quick! You know what to do. Stanch the flow of blood. Do something, man!
      You have seen men with mortal wounds, and this man <i>must</i> be saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He worked swiftly, deftly, for he did know what to do. He had worked over
      men before with wounds in their breasts, and he had seen them through the
      shadow of death. But he could not help thinking, as he now worked, that he
      was never known to miss a shilling at thirty paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was speaking. Her voice was low, with a persistent note of accusation
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an accident, do you understand? You did not shoot to kill him. The
      world shall never know the truth, unless he dies, and that is not to
      happen. You are safe. The law cannot touch you, for I shall never speak.
      This is between you and me. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her set, rigid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It was an accident. And this is between you and me. We shall settle
      it later on. Now I see you as you are&mdash;as Yvonne. I&mdash;wonder&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       His hand shook with a sudden spasm of indecision. He had again caught that
      baffling look in her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attend!&rdquo; she cried, and he bent to the task again. &ldquo;He is not going to
      die. It would be too cruel if he were to die now and miss all the joy of
      victory over you, his lifelong foe. He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened behind them and they looked up to see the breathless
      Hindu. He came straight to the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes. Ranjab has obey. I have told him that the revolver was
      discharge accidentally, by myself, by the unhappy son of a dog, I. It is
      well. Ranjab is but a dog. He shall die to-day and his lips be
      sealed for ever. Have no fear. The dead shall be silent.&rdquo; His voice
      trailed off into a whisper, for his eyes were looking into hers. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
      whispered, after a moment, &ldquo;no; the dead are not silent. One who is dead
      has spoken to Ranjab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the woman. Brood's hands were shaking again, shaking and
      uncertain. &ldquo;The doctor? He comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even now,&rdquo; said the Hindu, turning toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr Hodder came blinking into the room. A gaping assistant from his office
      across the street followed close behind, carrying a box of instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn up the lights,&rdquo; said the surgeon crisply. It seemed hours before the
      soft glow was at its full and the room bathed in its mellow light. All
      this time not a word was uttered. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Dr Hodder at last. &ldquo;Now
      we'll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was kneeling beside Frederic an instant later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad!&rdquo; he said after a single glance. &ldquo;Wiley, get busy now. Clear that
      table, Ranjab. Water, quick, Wiley. Lively, Ranjab. Shove 'em off, don't
      waste time like that. Ah, now lend a hand, both of you. Easy! So!&rdquo; Three
      strong, nerveless pairs of hands raised the inert figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! What's this?&rdquo; The incomprehensible Hindu in his ruthless clearing
      of the table had left the revolver lying where Yvonne had placed it. &ldquo;Good
      Lord, take it away! It's done enough damage already.&rdquo; It was Wiley, the
      assistant, who picked it up gingerly and laid it on a chair near by. &ldquo;Now,
      where's the butler? Send for an ambulance, and&mdash;you, Wiley, call up
      the hospital and say&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; came in Yvonne's husky, imperative voice. &ldquo;No, not the hospital. He
      is not to be taken away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madam, you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist! It is not to be thought of, Dr Hodder. He must remain in this
      house. I will get his room ready for him. He is&mdash;to&mdash;stay&mdash;here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll see,&rdquo; said the surprised surgeon, and forthwith put her out
      of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Brood was standing stock-still and rigid in the centre of the
      room. He had not moved an inch from the position he had taken when the
      doctor pushed him aside in order to clear the way to the table. Yvonne
      came straight to him. The matter of half a yard separated them as she
      stopped and spoke to him, her voice so low that the bustling doctor could
      not have distinguished a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe it to Frederic to allow Ranjab's story to stand. There is no one
      to dispute it. I command you to protect the good name of your son. That
      weapon was accidentally discharged by your servant, and you will have to
      swear to it, James Brood, if called upon to do so, for I shall swear to
      it, and Ranjab, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall conceal nothing,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Do you think I am a craven coward
      as well as a&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, you will do as I command. He is going to live. That is why
      I demand it of you. If he were to die&mdash;well, even then you would not
      be permitted to speak. I shall stand here beside you, James Brood, and if
      you utter one word to contradict Ranjab's story I shall shoot you down.
      Can you not see how desperately in earnest I am?&rdquo; She reached over and
      caught up the revolver from the chair as she was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a full minute they looked into each other's eyes, and he&mdash;the
      strong, invulnerable Brood&mdash;was the first to give way. The steely
      glitter faded before the swift rush of a new feeling that swept over him&mdash;an
      extraordinary feeling of tenderness toward this woman who fought him with
      something more than her own cause at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. You are right. If he gets well, this beastly thing must
      never be known. We will leave it to him. If he chooses to tell the truth,
      then&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have your promise&mdash;<i>now?</i>&rdquo; she demanded intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Now go!&rdquo; Involuntarily he straightened his tall figure and pointed
      toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not to be removed from this house,&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes ago you were suggesting a different&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
      began sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole world has changed since then, James Brood,&rdquo; she said, and her
      shoulders drooped. Almost instantly she recovered her poise. &ldquo;I have a
      great deal to say to you later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a great deal,&rdquo; he said meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her flinch and was conscious of a curious pang, a poignant yet
      indefinable pang of remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went swiftly from the room. He looked for the revolver. It was gone.
      Somehow he found himself wondering if she had taken it away with her in
      the fear that he would turn it against himself in case&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No powder stains,&rdquo; he heard Hodder saying to his assistant. &ldquo;Not a sign
      of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; said the assistant, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't have been&mdash;no, of course not,&rdquo; went on the first speaker in
      a matter-of-fact tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't look that way,&rdquo; agreed the assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fired from some little distance, I'd say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen or twenty feet, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It suddenly dawned upon Brood that they were talking of suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven, Hodder, it&mdash;it wasn't <i>that!</i>&rdquo; he cried hoarsely.
      &ldquo;What right have you to doubt my word? I tell you I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your word, Jim? This is the first word you've spoken since I came into
      the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is it a mortal wound?&rdquo; broke from the other's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't tell. First aid now, that's the point. We'll get him downstairs in
      a few minutes. More light. I can't see a thing in this&mdash;hello! What's
      this? A photograph? Fell out of his pocket when I&mdash;oh, I see! Your
      wife. Sorry I got blood on it.&rdquo; He laid the small bit of pasteboard on the
      table. &ldquo;Wiley! See if you can get a mattress. We'll move him at once.
      Lively, my lad. He's alive, all right, Jim. Do our best. Looks bad. Poor
      kid. He's not had a very happy life of it, I'm afraid&mdash;I beg pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In considerable embarrassment he brought his comments to an end and bent
      lower to examine the small black hole in the left breast of his patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic's lips moved. The doctor's ear caught the strangled whisper that
      issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; he remarked, turning to Brood with something like awe in his
      eyes. &ldquo;I'm sure he said 'Mother.' But he never knew his mother, did he?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ours afterward
      Brood sat alone in the room where the tragedy occurred. Much had
      transpired in the interim to make those hours seem like separate and
      distinct years to him, each hour an epoch in which a vital and memorable
      incident had been added to his already overfull measure of experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had refused to see the newspaper men who came. Dr Hodder wisely had
      protested against secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder will out,&rdquo; he had said fretfully, little realising how closely the
      trite old saying applied to the situation. He had accepted the statements
      of Yvonne and Ranjab as to the accidental discharge of the weapon, but for
      some reason had refrained from asking Brood a single question, although he
      knew him to be a witness to the shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne saw the reporters and, later on, an inspector of police. Ranjab
      told his unhappy story. He had taken the weapon from a hook on the wall
      for the purpose of cleaning it. It had been hanging there for years, and
      all the time there had been a single cartridge left in the cylinder
      unknown to anyone. He had started to remove the cylinder as he left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these years the hammer had been raised; death had been hanging over
      them all the time that the pistol occupied its insecure position on the
      wall. Somehow, he could not tell how, the hammer fell as he tugged at the
      cylinder. No one could have known that the revolver was loaded. That was
      all that he could say, except to declare that if his master's son died he
      would end his own miserable, valueless life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His story was supported by the declarations of Mrs Brood, who, while
      completely exonerating her husband's servant, had but little to say in
      explanation of the affair. She kept her wits about her. Most people would
      have made the mistake of saying too much. She professed to know nothing
      except that they were discussing young Mr Brood's contemplated trip abroad
      and that her husband had given orders to his servants to pack a revolver
      in his son's travelling-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had paid but little attention to the Hindu's movements. All she could
      say was that it was an accident&mdash;a horrible, blighting accident. For
      the present it would not be possible for anyone to see the heart-broken
      father. Doubtless later on he would be in the mood to discuss the dreadful
      catastrophe, but not now. He was crushed with the horror of the thing that
      had happened. And so she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was in a state of subdued excitement. Servants spoke in whispers
      and tiptoed through the halls. Nurses and other doctors came. Two old men,
      shaking as with palsy, roamed about the place, intent only on worming
      their way into the presence of their friend and supporter to offer
      consolation and encouragement to him in his hour of tribulation. They
      shuddered as they looked into each other's faces, and they shook their
      heads without speaking, for their minds were filled with doubt. They did
      not question the truth of the story as told, but they had their own
      opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In support of the theory that they did not believe there was anything
      accidental in the shooting of Frederic it is only necessary to speak of
      their extraordinary attitude toward Ranjab. They shook hands with him and
      told him that Allah would reward him. Later on, after they had had time to
      think it all out for themselves, being somewhat slow of comprehension,
      they sought out James Brood and offered to accept all the blame for having
      loaded the revolver without consulting him, their object having been to
      destroy a cat that infested the alley hard by. They felt that it was
      absolutely necessary to account for the presence of the unexploded
      cartridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact, Jim, old man,&rdquo; insisted Mr Riggs, &ldquo;I am entirely to
      blame for the whole business. I ought to have had more sense than to leave
      a shell in&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had nothing to do with it,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes fiercely. &ldquo;It was I who
      loaded the devilish thing, and I'm going to confess to the police. To be
      perfectly honest about it, I sort of recollect cocking it before I hung it
      up on the nail. I sort of recollect it, I say, and that's more than you
      can do. No, sir, Jim; I'm the one to blame. I ought to be shot for my
      carelessness. It was&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no sense in your lying at a time like this,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs
      caustically, glaring at his lifelong friend. &ldquo;I suppose it's because he
      can't help it, Jim. Lying has got to be such a habit with him that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; interrupted Mr Dawes vigorously, &ldquo;to show you that I am not lying,
      I intend to give myself up to the police and take the full penalty for
      criminal and contributory negligence. I suppose you'll still say I'm lying
      after they've sent me to jail for a couple of years for&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I will,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs with conviction. &ldquo;And I shall have you
      arrested for perjury if you try any of your tricks on me. I loaded it, I
      cocked sir; I will,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs with conviction.
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you fired it off!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr Dawes savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Riggs took a long breath. &ldquo;Yes, sir, you scoundrel, I am ready to swear
      that I <i>did</i> fire it off!&rdquo; They glared at each other with such
      ferocity that Brood, coming between them, laid his hands on their
      shoulders, shaking his head as he spoke to them gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, old pals. I understand what it is you are trying to do. It's
      no use. I fired the shot. It isn't necessary to say anything more to you,
      I'm sure, except that, as God is my witness, I did not intend the bullet
      for Frederic. It was an accident in that respect. Thank you for what you
      would do. It isn't necessary, old pals. The story that Ranjab tells must
      stand for the time being. Later on&mdash;well, I may <i>write</i> my own
      story and give it to the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write it?&rdquo; said Mr Dawes, and Brood nodded his head slowly,
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jim, you&mdash;you mustn't do that!&rdquo; groaned Mr Dawes, appalled. &ldquo;You
      ain't such a coward as to do that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one bullet left in that revolver. Ranjab advised me to save it&mdash;for
      myself. He's a thoughtful fellow,&rdquo; said Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs, squaring himself, &ldquo;it's too bad that you didn't hit
      what you shot at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Dawes turned on him in a flash. &ldquo;None o' that, Joe,&rdquo; he said, and this
      time he was very much in earnest. &ldquo;She's all right. You'll all find out
      she's all right. I tell you a woman can't nurse a feller back from the
      edge of the grave, yes, from the very bottom of it almost, and not betray
      her true nature to that same feller in more&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; interrupted Mr Riggs, ignoring his comrade's defence, &ldquo;I see she's
      going to nurse Freddy. Well, sir, if I was you, I'd&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood stopped him with an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask you not to discuss Mrs Brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going to say, Jim, that if I was you I'd thank the Lord that
      she's going to do it,&rdquo; substituted Mr Riggs somewhat hastily. &ldquo;She's a
      wonderful nurse. She told me a bit ago that she was going to save his life
      in spite of the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Dr Hodder say?&rdquo; demanded Brood, pausing in his restless pacing
      of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says the poor boy is as good as dead,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't got a chance in a million,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were surprised to see Brood wince. He hadn't been so thin-skinned
      in the olden days. His nerve was going back on him, that's what it was;
      poor Jim! Twenty years ago he would have stiffened his back and taken it
      like a man. It did not occur to them that they might have broken the news
      to him with tact and consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can depend on us, Jim, to pull him through,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs
      quickly. &ldquo;Remember how we saved you back there in Calcutta when all the
      fool doctors said you hadn't a chance? Well, sir, we're still&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any feller can get well with a bullet through his&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
      Mr Dawes encouragingly, but stopped abruptly when he saw Brood put his
      hands over his eyes and sink dejectedly into a chair, a deep groan on his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we'd better go,&rdquo; whispered Mr Riggs, after a moment of
      indecision, and then, inspired by a certain fear for his friend, struck
      the gong resoundingly. Silently they made their way out of the room,
      encountering Ranjab just outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stick to it, Ranjab,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your dying breath,&rdquo; added Mr Dawes, and the Hindu, understanding,
      gravely nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Brood, long afterward, raising his haggard face to meet the
      gaze of the motionless brown man who had been standing in his presence for
      many minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ask permission of <i>sahib</i> to be near him until the end,&rdquo; said
      the Hindu. &ldquo;She will not go away. I have heard the words she say to the <i>sahibah</i>,
      and the <i>sahibah</i> is silent as the tomb. She say no word for herself,
      just sit and look at the floor and never move. Then she accuse the <i>sahibah</i>
      of being the cause of the young master's death, and the <i>sahibah</i>
      only nod her head to that and go out of the room and up to the place where
      the young master is, and they cannot keep her from going in. She just look
      at the woman in the white cap and the woman step aside. The <i>sahibah</i>
      is now with the young master and the doctors. She is not of this world, <i>sahib</i>,
      but of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miss Desmond? Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wait in the hall outside his door. Ranjab have speech with her. She
      does not believe Ranjab. She look into his eye and his eye is not honest;
      she see it all. She say the young master shoot himself and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell her the truth, Ranjab,&rdquo; said Brood stolidly. &ldquo;She must know,
      she and her mother. To-night I shall see them, but not now. Suicide!
      Poor, poor Lydia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lydia say she blame herself for everything. She is a coward, she
      say, and Ranjab he understand. She came yesterday and went away. Ranjab
      tell her the <i>sahib</i> no can see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday? I know. She came to plead with me. I know,&rdquo; groaned Brood
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not speak her thoughts to the world, <i>sahib</i>,&rdquo; asserted
      Ranjab. &ldquo;Thy servant have spoken his words and she will not deny him. It
      is for the young master's sake. But she say she <i>know</i> he shoot
      himself because he no can bear the disgrace&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, Ranjab,&rdquo; interrupted the master. &ldquo;To-night I shall tell her
      everything. Go now and fetch me the latest word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Hindu remained motionless just inside the door. His eyes were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ranjab talk to the winds, <i>sahib</i>. The winds speak to him. The young
      master is alive. The great doctor he search for the bullet. It is bad. But
      the <i>sahibah</i> stand between him and death. She hold back death. She
      laugh at death. She say it no can be. Ranjab know her now. Here in this
      room he see the two woman in her, and he no more will be blind. She stand
      there before Ranjab, who would kill, and out of the air came a new spirit
      to shield her. Her eyes are the eyes of another who does not live in the
      flesh, and Ranjab bends the knee. He see the inside. It is not black. It
      is full of light, a great big light, <i>sahib</i>. Thy servant would kill
      his master's wife, but, Allah defend! He cannot kill the wife who is
      already dead. His master's wives stand before him&mdash;two, not one&mdash;and
      his hand is stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood was regarding him through wide&mdash;open, incredulous eyes. &ldquo;You&mdash;you
      saw it, too?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The serpent is deadly. Many time Ranjab have take the poison from its
      fangs and it becomes his slave. He would have take the poison from the
      serpent in his master's house, but the serpent change before his eye and
      he become the slave. She speak to him on the voice of the wind and he
      obey. It is the law. Kismet! His master have of wives two. Two, <i>sahib</i>,
      the living and the dead. They speak with Ranjab to-day and he obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was dead silence in the room for many minutes after the remarkable
      utterances of the mystic. Master and man looked into each other's eyes and
      spoke no more, yet something passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>sahibah</i> has sent Roberts for a priest,&rdquo; said the Hindu at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A priest? But I am not a Catholic&mdash;nor Frederic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam is. The servants are saying that the priest will be here too late.
      They are wondering why you have not already killed me, <i>sahib</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Kill you, <i>too?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are now saying that the last stroke of the gong, <i>sahib</i>, was
      the death-sentence for Ranjab. It called me here to be slain by you.
      I have told them all that I fired the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down at once, my friend,&rdquo; said Brood, laying his hand on the man's
      shoulder. &ldquo;Let them see that I do not blame you, even though we permit
      them to believe this lie of ours. Go, my friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man bent his head and turned away. Near the door he stopped stock-still
      and listened intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>sahibah</i> comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, she said she would come to me here,&rdquo; said Brood, and his jaw
      hardened. &ldquo;Hodder&mdash;sent for me, Ranjab, an hour ago, but&mdash;but he
      was conscious then. His eyes were open. I&mdash;I could not look into
      them. There would have been hatred in them&mdash;hatred for me, and I&mdash;I
      could not go. I was a coward. Yes, a coward, after all. She would have
      been there to watch me as I cringed. I was afraid of what I might do to
      her then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not conscious now, <i>sahib</i>&rdquo; said the Hindu slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said the other, compressing his lips, &ldquo;I am afraid&mdash;I am
      afraid. Ranjab, you do not know what it means to be a coward! You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, <i>sahib</i>, you are brave enough to stand on the spot where he
      fell, where his blood flowed, and that is not what a coward would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and closed swiftly and he was gone. Brood allowed his
      dull, wondering gaze to sink to his feet. He was standing on the spot
      where Frederic had fallen. There was no blood there now. The rug had been
      removed, and before his own eyes the swift-moving Hindu had washed
      the floor and table and put the room in order. All this seemed ages ago.
      Since that time he had bared his soul to the smirking Buddha, and
      receiving no consolation from the smug image, had violently cursed the
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then he had waited&mdash;he had waited for many things to happen. He
      knew all that took place below stairs. He knew when Lydia came and he
      denied himself to her. The coming of the police, the nurses and the
      anæsthetician, and later on Mrs John Desmond and the reporters. All this
      he had known, for he had listened at a crack in the open door. And he had
      heard his wife's calm, authoritative voice in the hall below, giving
      directions. Now for the first time he looked about him and felt himself
      attended by ghosts. In that instant he came to hate this once-loved
      room, this cherished retreat, and all that it contained. He would never
      set his foot inside of its four walls again. It was filled with ghosts!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the corner of the table lay a great heap of manuscript, the story of
      his life up to the escape from Thassa. The sheets of paper had been
      scattered over the floor by the surgeon, but now they were back in perfect
      order, replaced by another hand. He thought of the final chapter that
      would have to be written if he went on with the journal. It would have to
      be written, for it was the true story of his life. He strode swiftly to
      the table. In another instant the work of many months would have been torn
      to bits of waste paper. But his hand was stayed. Someone had stopped
      outside his door. He could not hear a sound, and yet he knew that a hand
      was on the heavy latch. He suddenly recalled his remark to the old men. He
      would have to <i>write</i> the final chapter, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited. He knew that she was out there, collecting all of her strength
      for the coming interview. She was fortifying herself against the crisis
      that was so near at hand. To his own surprise and distress of mind he
      found himself trembling and suddenly deprived of the fierce energy that he
      had stored up for the encounter. He wondered whether he would command the
      situation, after all, notwithstanding his righteous charge against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had wantonly sought to entice Frederic, she had planned to dishonour
      her husband, she had proved herself unwholesome and false, and her heart
      was evil. And yet he wondered whether he would be able to stand his ground
      against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far she had ruled. At the outset he had attempted to assert his
      authority as the master of the house in this trying, heart-breaking
      hour, and she had calmly waved him aside. His first thought had been to
      take his proper place at the bedside of his victim and there to remain
      until the end, but she had said: &ldquo;You are not to go in. You have done
      enough for one day. If he must die, let it be in peace and not in fear.
      You are not to go in,&rdquo; and he had crept away to hide!
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered her words later on when Hodder sent for him to come down.
      &ldquo;Not in fear,&rdquo; she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the edge of the table, where it had reposed since Dr Hodder dropped it
      there, was the small photograph of Matilde. He had not touched it, but he
      had bent over it for many minutes at a time, studying the sweet, never-to-be-forgotten,
      and yet curiously unfamiliar features of that long-ago loved one. He
      looked at it now as he waited for the door to open, and his thoughts
      leaped back to the last glimpse he had ever had of that adorable face.
      Then it was white with despair and misery; here it looked up at him with
      smiling eyes and the languor of unbroken tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he realised that the room was quite dark. He dashed to the window
      and threw aside the broad, thick curtains. A stream of afternoon sunshine
      rushed into the place. He would have light this time; he would not be
      deceived by the darkness, as he had been once before. This time he would
      see her face plainly. There should be no sickening illusion. He
      straightened his tall figure and waited for the door to open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window at his back was open. He heard a penetrating but hushed voice
      speaking from one of the windows across the court, from his wife's window,
      he knew without a glance of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Céleste, her maid, was giving orders in great agitation to the furnace-man
      in the yard below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you big fool! I am not dismiss. I am not going away&mdash;no.
      Tak' <i>zem</i> back. <i>Madame</i> has change her mind. I am not fire
      non, <i>non!</i> Tak' zem back, <i>vitement!</i> I go some other day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened suddenly and Yvonne came into the room.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f she had
      hesitated outside the room to summon the courage to face the man who would
      demand so much of her, there was nothing in her manner when she entered to
      indicate that such had been the case. She approached him without a symptom
      of nervousness or irresolution. Her dark eyes met his without wavering,
      and there was purpose in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She devoted a single glance of surprise to the uncurtained window on
      entering the door, and an instant later scrutinised the floor with
      unmistakable interest, as if expecting to find something there to account
      for his motive in admitting the glare of light, something to confound and
      accuse her. But there was no fear in the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had put on a rather plain white blouse, open at the neck. The cuffs
      were rolled up nearly to the elbows, evidence that she had been using her
      hands in some active employment and had either forgotten or neglected to
      restore the sleeves to their proper position. A chic black walking-skirt
      lent to her trim, erect figure a suggestion of girlishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arms hung straight down at her sides, limply it would have seemed at
      first glance, but in reality they were rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come, as I said I would,&rdquo; she said, after a long, tense silence.
      Her voice was low, huskier than ever, but without a tremor of excitement.
      &ldquo;You did not say you would wait for me here, but I knew you would do so.
      The hour of reckoning has come. We must pay, both of us. I am not
      frightened by your silence, James, nor am I afraid of what you may say or
      do. First of all, it is expected that Frederic will die. Dr Hodder has
      proclaimed it. He is a great surgeon. He ought to know. But he doesn't
      know&mdash;do you hear? He does not know. I shall not let him die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, if you please,&rdquo; said her husband coldly. &ldquo;You may spare me
      the theatrics. Moreover, we will not discuss Frederic. What we have to say
      to each other has little to do with that poor boy downstairs. This is <i>your</i>
      hour of reckoning, not his. Bear that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very much mistaken,&rdquo; she interrupted, her gaze growing more fixed
      than before. &ldquo;He is a part of our reckoning. He is the one great character
      in this miserable, unlooked-for tragedy. Will you be so kind as to
      draw those curtains? And do me the honour to allow me to sit in your
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was infinite scorn in her voice. &ldquo;I am very tired. I have not been
      idle. Every minute of my waking hours belongs to your son, James Brood,
      but I owe this half-hour to you. You shall know the truth about me,
      as I know it about you. I did not count on this hour ever being a part of
      my life, but it has to be, and I shall face it without weeping over what
      might have been. Will you draw the curtains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment and then jerked the curtains together, shutting out
      the pitiless glare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be seated there?&rdquo; he said quietly, pointing to a chair at the
      end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She switched on the light in the big lamp, but instead of taking the chair
      indicated, sank into one on the opposite side of the table, with the
      mellow light full upon her lovely, serious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit there,&rdquo; she said, signifying the chair he had requested her to take.
      &ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; she went on impatiently, as he continued to regard her
      forbiddingly from his position near the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be better able to say what I have to say standing,&rdquo; he said
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect me to plead with you for forgiveness?&rdquo; she inquired, with
      an unmistakable look of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may save yourself the humiliation of such&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are gravely mistaken,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;I shall ask nothing of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we need not prolong the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to explain, not to plead,&rdquo; she went on resolutely. &ldquo;I want to
      tell you why I married you. You will not find it a pleasant story, nor
      will you be proud of your conquest. It will not be necessary for you to
      turn me out of your house. I entered it with the determination to leave it
      in my own good time. I think you had better sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her fixedly for a moment, as if striving to materialise a
      thought that lay somewhere in the back of his mind. He was vaguely
      conscious of an impression that he could unfathom all this seeming
      mystery without a suggestion from her if given the time to concentrate his
      mind on the vague, hazy suggestion that tormented his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down opposite her and rested his arms on the table. The lines about
      his mouth were rigid, uncompromising, but there was a look of wonder in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward in her chair, the better to watch the changing
      expression in his eyes as she progressed with her story. Her hands were
      clenched tightly under the table's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking into my eyes, as you have looked a hundred times,&rdquo; she
      said after a moment. &ldquo;There is something in them that has puzzled you
      since the night when you looked into them across that great ballroom in
      London. You have always felt that they were not new to you, that you have
      had them constantly in front of you for ages. Do you remember when you
      first saw me, James Brood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared, and his eyes widened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw you in my life until that night in London, I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look closely. Isn't there something more than doubt in your mind as you
      look into them now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess that I have always been puzzled by by something I cannot
      understand in&mdash;but all this leads to nothing,&rdquo; he broke off harshly.
      &ldquo;We are not here to mystify each other, but to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To explain mysteries, that's it, of course. You are looking. What do you
      see? Are you not sure that you looked into my eyes long, long ago? Are
      there not moments when my voice is familiar to you, when it speaks to you
      out of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat up, rigid as a block of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by Heaven, I have felt it all along! To-day I was convinced
      that the unbelievable had happened. I saw something that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped short, his lips parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved her hand in the direction of the Buddha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never petitioned your too-stolid friend over there to
      unravel the mystery for you? In the quiet of certain lonely, speculative
      hours have you not wondered where you had seen me before, long, long
      before the night in London? In all the years that you have been trying to
      convince yourself that Frederic is not your son has there not been the
      vision of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying to me? Are you trying to tell me that you are
      Matilde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not Matilde, then who am I, pray?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank back frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be possible. I would know her a thousand years from now. You
      cannot trick me into believing&mdash;but, who are you?&rdquo; He leaned forward
      again, clutching the edge of the table. &ldquo;I sometimes think you are a ghost
      come to haunt me, to torture me. What trick, what magic is behind all
      this? Has her soul, her spirit, her actual being found a lodging-place
      in you, and have you been sent to curse me for&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose half-way out of her chair, leaning farther across the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, James Brood, I represent the spirit of Matilde Valeska, if you will
      have it so. Not sent to curse you, but to love you. That's the pity of it
      all. I swear to you that it is the spirit of Matilde that urges me to love
      you and to spare you now. It is the spirit of Matilde that stands between
      her son and death. But it is not Matilde who confronts you here and now,
      you may be sure of that. Matilde loved you. She loves you now, even in her
      grave. You will never be able to escape from that wonderful love of hers.
      If there have been times&mdash;and God help me, there were many, I know&mdash;when
      I appeared to love you for myself, I swear to you that I was moved by the
      spirit of Matilde. I&mdash;I am as much mystified, as greatly puzzled as
      yourself. I came here to hate you, and I have loved you; yes, there were
      moments when I actually loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice died away into a whisper. For many seconds they sat looking into
      each other's eyes, neither possessing the power to break the strange spell
      of silence that had fallen upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not Matilde who confronts you now, but one who would not spare
      you as she did up to the hour of her death. You are quite safe from ghosts
      from this hour on, my friend. You will never see Matilde again, though you
      look into my eyes till the end of time. Frederic may see, may feel the
      spirit of his mother, but you&mdash;ah, no! You have seen the last of her.
      Her blood is in my veins, her wrongs are in my heart. It was she with whom
      you fell in love, and it was she you married six months ago, but now the
      curtain is lifted. Don't you know me now, James? Can your memory carry you
      back twenty-three years and deliver you from doubt and perplexity?
      Look closely, I say. I was six years old then, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood was glaring at her as one stupefied. Suddenly he cried out in a loud
      voice. &ldquo;You are you are the little sister? The little Thérèse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing now, leaning far over the table, for he had shrunk down
      into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little Thérèse, yes! Now do you begin to see? Now do you begin to
      realise what I came here to do? Now do you know why I married you? Isn't
      it clear to you? Well, I have tried to do all these things so that I might
      break your heart as you broke hers. I came to make you pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was speaking rapidly, excitedly now. Her voice was high-pitched
      and unnatural. Her eyes seemed to be driving him deeper and deeper into
      the chair, forcing him down as though with a giant's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little, timid, heart-broken Thérèse who would not speak to you,
      nor kiss you, nor say goodbye to you when you took her darling sister away
      from the Bristol in the <i>Kartnerring</i> more than twenty years ago. Ah,
      how I loved her, how I loved her! And how I hated you for taking her away
      from me. Shall I ever forget that wedding night? Shall I ever forget the
      grief, the loneliness, the hatred that dwelt in my poor little heart that
      night? Everyone was happy, the whole world was happy; but was I? I was
      crushed with grief. You were taking her away across the awful sea, and you
      were to make her happy, so they said, <i>aïe</i>, so said my beloved,
      joyous sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stood before the altar in St Stephens's with her and promised,
      promised, promised everything. I heard you. I sat with my mother and
      turned to ice, but I heard you. All Vienna, all Budapest said that you
      promised naught but happiness to each other. She was twenty-one. She
      was lovely; ah, far lovelier than that wretched photograph lying there in
      front of you. It was made when she was eighteen. She did not write those
      words on the back of the card. I wrote them, not more than a month ago,
      before I gave it to Frederic. To this house she came twenty-three
      years ago. You brought her here the happiest girl in all the world. How
      did you send her away? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stirred in the chair. A spasm of pain crossed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was the happiest man in all the world,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;You are
      forgetting one thing, Thérèse.&rdquo; He fell into the way of calling her
      Thérèse as if he had known her by no other name. &ldquo;Your sister was not
      content to preserve the happiness that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;You are not to speak evil of her now. You will
      never think evil of her after what I am about to tell you. You will curse
      yourself. Somehow I am glad that my plans have gone awry. It gives me the
      opportunity to see you curse yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her sister!&rdquo; muttered the man unbelievingly. &ldquo;I have married the child
      Thérèse. I have held her sister in my arms all these months and never
      knew. It is a dream. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you have <i>felt</i>, even though&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck the table violently with his fist. His eyes were blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What manner of woman are you? What were you planning to do to that
      unhappy boy&mdash;her son? Are you a fiend to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good time, James, you will know what manner of woman I am,&rdquo; she
      interrupted quietly. Sinking back in the chair, she resumed the broken
      strain, all the time watching him through half&mdash;closed eyes. &ldquo;She
      died ten years ago. Her boy was twelve years old. She never saw him after
      the night you turned her away from this house. On her death-bed, as
      she was releasing her pure, undefiled soul to God's keeping, she repeated
      to the priest who went through the unnecessary form of absolving her, she
      repeated her solemn declaration that she had never wronged you by thought
      or deed. I had always believed her, the holy priest believed her, God
      believed her. You would have believed her, too, James Brood. She was a
      good woman. Do you hear? And you put a curse upon her and drove her out
      into the night. That was not all. You persecuted her to the end of her
      unhappy life. You did that to my sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you married me,&rdquo; he muttered thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not because I loved you; oh, no! She loved you to the day of her death,
      after all the misery and suffering you had heaped upon her. No woman ever
      endured the anguish that she suffered throughout those hungry years. You
      kept her child from her. You denied him to her, even though you denied him
      to yourself. Why did you keep him from her? She was his mother. She had
      borne him; he was all hers. But no! It was your revenge to deprive her of
      the child she had brought into the world. You worked deliberately in this
      plan to crush what little there was left in life for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You kept him with you, though you branded him with a name I cannot utter;
      you guarded him as if he were your most precious possession, and not a
      curse to your pride; you did this because you knew that you could drive
      the barb more deeply into her tortured heart. You allowed her to die,
      after years of pleading, after years of vain endeavour, without one
      glimpse of her boy, without ever having heard the word mother on his lips.
      That is what you did to my sister. For twelve long years you gloated over
      her misery. Man, man, how I hated you when I married you!&rdquo; She paused,
      breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are creating an excuse for your devilish conduct!&rdquo; he exclaimed
      harshly. &ldquo;You are like Matilde, false to the core. You married me for the
      luxury I could provide, notwithstanding the curse I had put upon your
      sister. I don't believe a word of what you are saying to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you believe that I am her sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, yes; I must believe that. Why have I been so blind? You are the
      little Thérèse, and you hated me in those other days. I remember well the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child's despairing hatred because you were taking away the being she
      loved best of all. Will you believe me when I say that my hatred did not
      endure for long? When her happy, joyous letters came back to us filled
      with accounts of your goodness, your devotion, I allowed my hatred to die.
      I forgot that you had robbed me. I came to look upon you as the fairy
      prince, after all. It was not until she came all the way across the ocean
      and began to die before our eyes&mdash;she was years in dying&mdash;it was not
      until then that I began to hate you with a real, undying hatred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you gave yourself to me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You put yourself in her
      place! In Heaven's name, what was to be gained by such an act as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to take Matilde's boy away from you,&rdquo; she hurried on, and for
      the first time her eyes began to waver. &ldquo;The idea suggested itself to me
      the night I met you at the comtesse's dinner. It was a wonderful, a
      tremendous thought that entered my brain. At first my real self revolted,
      but as time went on the idea became an obsession. I married you, James
      Brood, for the sole purpose of hurting you in the worst possible way: by
      having Matilde's son strike you where the pain would be the greatest. Ah,
      you are thinking that I would have permitted myself to have become his
      mistress, but you are mistaken. I am not that bad. I would not have damned
      his soul in that way. I would not have betrayed my sister in that way. Far
      more subtle was my design. I confess that it was my plan to make him fall
      in love with me and in the end to run away with him, leaving you to think
      that the very worst had happened. But it would not have been as you think.
      He would have been protected, my friend, amply protected. He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would have wrecked him; don't you see that you would have wrecked
      the life you sought to protect? How blind and unfeeling you were. You say
      that he was my son and Matilde's, honestly born. What was your object, may
      I inquire, in striking me at such cost to him? You would have made a
      scoundrel of him for the sake of a personal vengeance. Are you forgetting
      that he regarded himself as my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I do not forget, James. There was but one way in which I could hope
      to steal him away from you, and I went about it deliberately, with my eyes
      open. I came here to induce him to run away with me. I would have taken
      him back to his mother's home, to her grave, and there I would have told
      him what you did to her. If, after hearing my story, he elected to return
      to the man who had destroyed his mother, I should have stepped aside and
      offered no protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I would have taken him away from you in the manner that would have
      hurt you the worst. My sister was true to you. I would have been just as
      true, and after you had suffered the torments of hell, it was my plan to
      reveal everything to you. But you would have had your punishment by that
      time. When you were at the very end of your strength, when you trembled on
      the edge of oblivion, then I would have hunted you out and laughed at you
      and told you the truth. But you would have had years of anguish&mdash;years,
      I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already had years of agony, pray do not overlook that fact,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;I suffered for twenty years. I was at the edge of oblivion more than
      once, if it is a pleasure for you to hear me say it, Thérèse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not offset the pain that her suffering brought to me. It does not
      counterbalance the unhappiness you gave to her boy, nor the stigma you put
      upon him. I am glad that you suffered. It proves to me that you secretly
      considered yourself to be in the wrong. You doubted yourself. You were
      never sure, and yet you crushed the life out of her innocent, bleeding
      heart. You let her die without a word to show that you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was lost to the world for years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There were many years when
      I was not in touch with&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her letters must have reached you. She wrote a thousand of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never reached me,&rdquo; he said significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ordered them to be destroyed?&rdquo; she cried in sudden comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must decline to answer that question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a curious, incredulous smile and then abruptly returned to
      her charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my sister came home, degraded, I was nine years of age, but I was
      not so young that I did not know that a dreadful thing had happened to
      her. She was blighted beyond all hope of recovery. It was to me, little
      me, that she told her story over and over again, and it was I to whom she
      read all of the pitiful letters she wrote to you. My father wanted to come
      to America to kill you. He did come later on to plead with you and to kill
      you if you would not listen to him. But you had gone&mdash;to Africa, they
      said. I could not understand why you would not give to her that little
      baby boy. He was hers, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short in her recital and covered her eyes with her hands. He
      waited for her to go on, sitting as rigid as the image that faced him from
      beyond the table's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterward my father and my uncles made every effort to get the child away
      from you, but he was hidden; you know how carefully he was hidden so that
      she might never find him. For ten years they searched for him, and you.
      For ten years she wrote to you, begging you to let her have him, if only
      for a little while at a time. She promised to restore him to you. You
      never replied. You scorned her. We were rich, very rich. But our money was
      of no help to us in the search for her boy. You had secreted him too well.
      At last, one day, she told me what it was that you accused her of doing.
      She told me about Guido Feverelli, her music-master. I knew him,
      James. He had known her from childhood. He was one of the finest men I
      have ever seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in love with her,&rdquo; grated Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. Who knows? But if so, he never uttered so much as one word of
      love to her. He challenged you. Why did you refuse to fight him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she begged me not to kill him. Did she tell you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But that was not the real reason. It was because you were not sure
      of your ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind! It is enough that poor Feverelli passed out of her life. She
      did not see him again until just before she died. He was a noble
      gentleman. He wrote but one letter to her after that wretched day in this
      house. I have it here in this packet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a package of letters, tied with a white ribbon, from her bosom
      and laid it upon the table before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one letter from him,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I have brought it here for you to
      read. But not now. There are other letters and documents here for you to
      consider. They are from the grave. Ah, I do not wonder that you shrink and
      draw back from them. They convict you, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I can see why you have taken up this fight against me. You&mdash;you
      knew she was innocent,&rdquo; he said in a low, unsteady voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why I have hated you, <i>aïe?</i> But what you do not understand is
      how I could have brought myself to the point of loving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loving me! Good Heaven, woman, what do you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loving you in spite of myself,&rdquo; she cried, beating upon the table with
      her hands. &ldquo;I have tried to convince myself that it was not I, but the
      spirit of Matilde that had come to lodge in my treacherous body. I hated
      you for myself and I loved you for Matilde. She loved you to the end. She
      never hated you. That was it. The pure, deathless love of Matilde was
      constantly fighting against the hatred I bore for you. I believe as firmly
      as I believe that I am alive that she has been near me all the time,
      battling against my insane desire for vengeance. You have only to recall
      to yourself the moments when you were so vividly reminded of Matilde
      Valeska. At those times I am sure that something of Matilde was in me. I
      was not myself. You have looked into my eyes a thousand times with a
      question in your own. Your soul was striving to reach the soul of Matilde.
      Ah, all these months I have known that you love Matilde, not me. You loved
      Matilde that was in me. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of her, always of her, when you were in my arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how well you loved her,&rdquo; she declared slowly. &ldquo;I know that you
      went to her tomb long after her death was revealed to you. I know that
      years ago you made an effort to find Feverelli. You found his grave, too,
      and you could not ask him, man to man, if you had wronged her. But in
      spite of all that you brought up her boy to be sacrificed as&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;am I to believe you? If he should be my son!&rdquo; he cried,
      starting up, cold with dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is your son. He could be no other man's son. I have her dying word for
      it. She declared it in the presence of her God. Wait! Where are you
      going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going down to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, James. I have still more to say to you, more to confess. Here!
      Take this package of letters. Read them as you sit beside his bed&mdash;not
      his death-bed, for I shall restore him to health, never fear. If he
      were to die I should curse myself to the end of time, for I and I alone
      would have been the cause. Here are her letters, and the one Feverelli
      wrote to her. This is her death-bed letter to you. And this is a
      letter to her son and yours. You may some day read it to him. And here&mdash;this
      is a document requiring me to share my fortune with her son. It is a
      pledge that I took before my father died a few years ago. If the boy ever
      appeared he was to have his mother's share of the estate, and it is not an
      inconsiderable amount, James. He is independent of you. He need ask
      nothing of you. I was taking him home to his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank slightly as he stood over her. There was more of wonder and
      pity in his face than condemnation. She looked for the anger she had
      expected to arouse in him, and was dumbfounded to see that it was not
      revealed in his steady, appraising eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your plan deserved a better fate than this, Yv&mdash;Thérèse. It was
      prodigious! I&mdash;I can almost pity you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no pain, no regret, no grief?&rdquo; she cried weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, controlling himself with difficulty. &ldquo;Yes, I know all
      these and more.&rdquo; He picked up the package of letters and glanced at the
      superscription on the outer envelope. Suddenly he raised them to his lips
      and, with his eyes closed, kissed the words that were written there. Her
      head drooped and a sob came into her throat. She did not look up until he
      began speaking to her again, quietly, even patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you, even in your longing for revenge, have planned to
      humiliate and degrade him even more than I could have done? Was it just to
      your sister's son that you should blight his life, that you should turn
      him into a skulking, sneaking betrayer? What would you have gained in the
      end? His loathing, his scorn. Thérèse, did you not think of all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you that I thought of everything. I was mistaken. I did not
      stop to think that I would be taking him away from happiness in the shape
      of love that he might bear for someone else. I did not know that there was
      a Lydia Desmond. When I came to know my heart softened and my purpose lost
      most of its force. He would have been safe with me, but would he have been
      happy? I could not give him the kind of love that Lydia promised. I could
      only be his mother's sister to him. He was not in love with me. He has
      always loved Lydia. I fascinated him, just as I fascinated you. He would
      not have gone away with me, even after you had told him that he was not
      your son. He would not do that to you, James, in spite of the blow you
      struck him. He was loyal to Lydia and to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he think of <i>you?</i>&rdquo; demanded Brood scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had not come upon us here he would have known me for who I am, and
      he would have forgiven me. I had asked him to go away with me. He refused.
      Then I was about to tell him the whole story of my life, of his life, and
      of yours. Do you think he would have refused forgiveness to me? No! He
      would have understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But up to that hour he thought of you as&mdash;what shall I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad woman? Perhaps. I did not care. It was part of the price I was to
      pay in advance. I would have told him everything as soon as the ship on
      which we sailed was outside the harbour yonder. That was my intention, and
      I know you believe me when I say that there was nothing more in my mind.
      Time would have straightened everything out for him. He could have had his
      Lydia, even though he went away with me. Once away from here, do you think
      that he would ever return? No! Even though he knew you to be his father,
      he would not forget that he has never been your son. You have hurt him
      since he was a babe. Would he forget? Would he forgive? No! When you came
      into this room and found us, I was about to go down on my knees to him to
      thank him for saving me from my own designs. I realised then, as I had
      come to suspect in the past few months, that I had not counted on my own
      conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James, I&mdash;I would not have carried out my plan. I had faltered, and
      my cause was lost. What have I accomplished? Am I able to gloat over you?
      What have I wrought, after all? I weakened under the love she bore for
      you, I permitted it to creep in and fill my heart. Do you understand? I do
      not hate you now. It is something to know that you have worshipped her all
      these years. You were true to her. What you did long, long ago was not
      your fault. You believed that she had wronged you. But you went on loving
      her. That is what weakened my resolve. You loved her to the end, she loved
      you to the end. Well, in the face of that, could I go on hating you? You
      must have been worthy of her love. She knew you better than all the world.
      You came to me with love for her in your heart. You took me, and you loved
      her all the time. I am not sure, James, that you are not entitled to this
      miserable, unhappy love I have come to feel for you&mdash;my own love, not
      Matilde's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are saying this so that I may refrain from throwing you out into the
      street&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried, coming to her feet. &ldquo;I shall ask nothing of you. If I am
      to go, it shall be because I have failed. I have been a blind,
      vainglorious fool. The trap has caught me instead of you, and I shall take
      the consequences. I have lost everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lost <i>everything</i>,&rdquo; said he steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You despise me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot ask you to stay here after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall not go. I have a duty to perform before I leave this house. I
      intend to save the life of that poor boy downstairs, so that he may not
      die believing me to be an evil woman, a faithless wife. Thank God, I have
      accomplished something! You know that he is your son. You know that my
      sister was as pure as snow. You know that you killed her, and that she
      loved you in spite of the death you brought to her. That is something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood dropped into the chair and buried his face on his quivering arms. In
      muffled tones came the cry from his soul:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've all said that he is like me. I have seen it at times, but I would
      not believe. I fought against it resolutely, madly, cruelly! Now it is too
      late and I <i>see!</i> I see, I feel! You curse of mankind, you have
      driven me to the killing of my own son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood over him, silent for a long time, her hand hovering above his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not going to die,&rdquo; she said at last, when she was sure that she had
      full command of her voice. &ldquo;I can promise you that, James. I shall not go
      from this house until he is well. I shall nurse him to health and give him
      back to you and Matilde, for now I know that he belongs to both of you and
      not to her alone. Now, James, you may go down to him. He is not conscious.
      He will not hear you praying at his bedside. He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A knock came at the door&mdash;a sharp, imperative knock. It was repeated
      several times before either of them could summon the courage to call out.
      They were petrified with the dread of something that awaited them beyond
      the closed door. It was she who finally called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr Hodder, coatless and bare-armed, came into the room.

      for a moment. The two were leaning forward with alarm in their eyes, their
      hands gripping the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, are we to send for an undertaker?&rdquo; demanded Hodder irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood started forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is he dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, but he might as well be!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor. It was
      plain to be seen that he was very much out of patience. &ldquo;You've called in
      another doctor and a priest, and now I hear that a Presbyterian parson is
      in the library. Hang it all, Brood, why don't you send for the coroner and
      undertaker and have done with it! I'm blessed if I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne came swiftly to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he conscious? Does he know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hodder, is there any hope?&rdquo; cried Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be honest with you, Jim. I don't believe there is. It went in here,
      above the heart, and it's lodged back here by the spine somewhere. We
      haven't located it yet, but we will. Had to let up on the ether for a
      while, you see. He opened his eyes a few minutes ago, Mrs Brood, and my
      assistant is certain that he whispered Lydia Desmond's name. Sounded that
      way to him, but, of course&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! You see, James?&rdquo; she cried, whirling upon her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you'd better step in and see him now, Jim,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      suddenly becoming very gentle. &ldquo;He may come to again, and it may be the
      last time he'll ever open his eyes. Yes, it's as bad as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go,&rdquo; said Brood, his face ashen. &ldquo;You must revive him for a few
      minutes, Hodder. There's something I've got to say to him. He must be able
      to hear and understand me. It is the most important thing in the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He choked up suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to be careful, Jim. He's ready to collapse. Then it's all
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, Dr Hodder, my husband has something to say to his son that
      cannot be put off for an instant. I think it will mean a great deal to him
      in his fight for recovery. It will make life worth living for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hodder stared for a second or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll need a lot of courage, and if anything can put it into him he'll
      make a better fight. If you get a chance, say it to him, Jim. If it's got
      anything to do with his mother, say it. He has moaned the word a dozen
      times&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has to do with his mother!&rdquo; Brood cried out. &ldquo;Come! I want you to hear
      it, too, Hodder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't much time to lose, I'm afraid,&rdquo; began Hodder, shaking his
      head. His gaze suddenly rested on Mrs Brood's face. She was very erect,
      and a smile such as he had never seen before was on her lips, a smile that
      puzzled and yet inspired him with a positive, undeniable feeling of
      encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not going to die, Dr Hodder,&rdquo; she said quietly. Something went
      through his body that warmed it curiously. He felt a thrill, as one who is
      seized by a great, overpowering excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      She preceded them into the hall. Brood came last. He closed the door
      behind him after a swift glance about the room that had been his most
      private retreat for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was never to set foot inside its walls again. In that single glance he
      bade farewell to it for ever.
      It was a hated, unlovely spot. He had spent an age in it during those
      bitter morning hours, an age of imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the landing below they came upon Lydia. She was seated on a window-ledge,
      leaning wearily against the casement. She did not rise as they approached,
      but watched them with steady, smouldering eyes in which there was no
      friendliness, no compassion. They were her enemies; they had killed the
      thing she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brood's eyes met hers for an instant, and then fell before the bitter look
      they encountered. His shoulders drooped as he passed close by her
      motionless figure and followed the doctor down the hall to the bedroom
      door. It opened and closed an instant later and he was with his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Lydia's sombre, piteous gaze hung upon the door through
      which he had passed and which was closed so cruelly against her, the one
      who loved him best of all. At last she looked away; her attention was
      caught by a queer, clicking sound near at hand. She was surprised to find
      Yvonne Brood standing close beside her, her eyes closed and her fingers
      telling the beads that ran through her fingers, her lips moving in
      voiceless prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl watched her dully for a few moments, then with growing
      fascination. The incomprehensible creature was praying! To Lydia this
      seemed to be the most unnatural thing in all the world. She could not
      associate prayer with this woman's character; she could not imagine her
      having been in all her life possessed of a fervent religious thought. It
      was impossible to think of her as being even hypocritically pious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia began to experience a strange feeling of irritation. She turned her
      face away, unwilling to be a witness to this shallow mockery. She was
      herself innately religious. In her secret soul she resented an appeal to
      Heaven by this luxurious worldling; she could not bring herself to think
      of her as anything else. Prayer seemed a profanation on her scarlet lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia believed that Frederic had shot himself. She put Yvonne down as the
      real cause of the calamity that had fallen upon the house. But for her,
      James Brood never would have had a motive for striking the blow that
      crushed all desire to live out of the unhappy boy. She had made of her
      husband an unfeeling monster, and now she prayed! She had played with the
      emotions of two men, and now she begged to be pardoned for her folly! An
      inexplicable desire to laugh at the plight of the trifler came over the
      girl, but even as she checked it another and more unaccountable force
      ordered her to obey the impulse to turn once more to look into the face of
      her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne was looking at her. She had ceased telling the beads, and her hands
      hung limply at her sides. For a full minute, perhaps, the two regarded
      each other without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not going to die, Lydia,&rdquo; said Yvonne gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl started to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it is your prayer, and not mine, that has reached God's
      ears?'&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prayer of a nobler woman than either of you or I has gone to the
      throne,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia's eyes grew dark with resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could have prevented all&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be good enough to remember that you have said all that to me before,
      Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your object in keeping me away from him at such a time as this,
      Mrs Brood?&rdquo; demanded Lydia. &ldquo;You refuse to let me go in to him. Is it
      because you are afraid of what&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are trying days ahead of us, Lydia,&rdquo; interrupted Yvonne. &ldquo;We will
      have to face them together. I can promise you this: Frederic will be saved
      for you. To-morrow, next day, perhaps, I may be able to explain
      everything to you. You hate me to-day. Everyone in this house hates
      me, even Frederic. There is a day coming when you will not hate me. That
      was my prayer, Lydia. I was not praying for Frederic, but for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For yourself? I might have known you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hesitate? Perhaps it is just as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say to you, Mrs Brood, that it is my purpose to remain in this
      house as long as I can be&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome, Lydia. You will be the one great tonic that is to
      restore him to health of mind and body. Yes, I shall go further and say
      that you are commanded to stay here and help me in the long fight that is
      ahead of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; the girl was surprised into saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them turned quickly as the door to Frederic's room opened and
      James Brood came out into the hall. His face was drawn with pain and
      anxiety, but the light of exaltation was in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Lydia,&rdquo; he said softly, after he had closed the door behind him.
      &ldquo;He knows me. He is conscious. Hodder can't understand it, but he seems to
      have suddenly grown stronger. He&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stronger?&rdquo; cried Yvonne, the ring of triumph in her voice. &ldquo;I knew! I
      could feel it coming&mdash;his strength&mdash;even out here, James. Yes,
      go in now, Lydia. You will see a strange sight, my dear. James Brood will
      kneel beside his son and tell him&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Brood, spreading out his hands in a gesture of admission.
      &ldquo;You must hear it, too, Lydia. Not you, Thérèse! You are not to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant you ten minutes, James,&rdquo; she said with the air of a dictator.
      &ldquo;After that I shall take my stand beside him and you will not be needed.&rdquo;
       She struck her breast sharply with her clenched hand. &ldquo;His one and only
      hope lies here, James. I am his salvation. I am his strength. When you
      come out of that room again it will be to stay out until I give the word
      for you to re-enter. Go, now, and put spirit into him. That is all I
      ask of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared for a moment and then lowered his head. A moment later Lydia
      followed him into the room and Yvonne was alone in the hall. Alone? Ranjab
      was ascending the stairs. He came and stood before her and bent his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; she said, looking down upon him without a vestige of the old
      dread in her eyes. &ldquo;I have a friend, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n a warm morning,
      toward the middle of June, Frederic and Lydia sat in the quaint, old-world
      courtyard, almost directly beneath the balcony of Yvonne's boudoir. He
      lounged comfortably, yet weakly, in the invalid-chair that had been
      wheeled to the spot by Ranjab, and she sat on a pile of cushions at his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at him, one would not have thought that he had passed through the
      valley of the shadow of death and was but now emerging into the sunshine
      of security. His face was pale, but there was a healthy gloss to the skin
      and a clear light in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week or more he had been permitted to walk about the house and into
      the garden, always leaning on the arm of his father or the faithful Hindu.
      Each succeeding day saw his strength and vitality increase, and each night
      he slept with the peace of a care-free child. He was filled with
      contentment; he loved life as he had never dreamed it would be possible
      for him to love it. There was a song in his heart and there was a bright
      star always on the edge of his horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Lydia, she was radiant with happiness. The long fight was over. She
      had gone through the campaign against death with loyal, unfaltering
      courage; there had never been an instant when her staunch heart had failed
      her; there had been distress, but never despair. If the strain told on her
      it did not matter, for she was of the fighting kind. Her love was the
      sustenance on which she throve, despite the beggarly offerings that were
      laid before her during those weeks of famine. Her strong, young body lost
      none of its vigour; her splendid spirit gloried in the tests to which it
      was subjected, and now she was as serene as the June day that found her
      wistfully contemplating the results of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Times there were when a pensive mood brought the touch of sadness to her
      grateful heart. She was happy and Frederic was happy, but what of the one
      who actually had wrought the miracle? That one alone was unhappy,
      unrequited, undefended. There was no place for her in the new order of
      things. When Lydia thought of her, as she often did, it was with an
      indescribable craving in her soul. She longed for the hour to come when
      Yvonne Brood would lay aside the mask of resignation and demand tribute;
      when the strange defiance that held all of them at bay would disappear,
      and they could feel that she no longer regarded them as adversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no longer a symptom of rancour in the heart of Lydia Desmond.
      She realised that her beloved's recovery was due almost entirely to the
      remarkable influence exercised by this woman at a time when mortal
      agencies appeared to be of no avail. Her absolute certainty that she had
      the power to thwart death, at least in this instance, had its effect not
      only on the wounded man, but on those who attended him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr Hodder and the nurses were not slow to admit that her magnificent
      courage, her almost scornful self-assurance, supplied them with an
      incentive that otherwise might never have got beyond the form of a mere
      hope. There was something positively startling in her serene conviction
      that Frederic was not to die. No less a sceptic than the renowned Dr
      Hodder confided to Lydia and her mother that he now believed in the
      supernatural and never again would say &ldquo;there is no God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hodder had gone to James Brood at the end of the third day and, with the
      sweat of the haunted on his brow, had whispered hoarsely that the case was
      out of his hands. He was no longer the doctor, but an agent governed by a
      spirit that would not permit death to claim its own. And somehow Brood
      understood far better than the man of science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The true story of the shooting had long been known to Lydia and her
      mother. Brood confessed everything to them. He assumed all of the blame
      for what had transpired on that tragic morning. He humbled himself before
      them, and when they shook their heads and turned their backs upon him he
      was not surprised, for he knew they were not convicting him of assault
      with a deadly firearm. Later on the story of Thérèse was told by him to
      Frederic and the girl. He did his wife no injustice in the recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederic laid his hand upon the soft brown head at his knee and voiced the
      thought that was in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wondering, as I am, too, what is to become of Yvonne after to-day,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;There must be an end, and if it doesn't come now, when will it
      come? To-morrow we sail. It is certain that she is not to accompany
      us. She has said so herself, and father has said so. So to-day must
      see the end of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederic, I want you to do something for me,&rdquo; said Lydia earnestly.
      &ldquo;There was a time when I could not have asked this of you, but now I
      implore you to speak to your father in her behalf. I love her, Freddy
      dear. I cannot help it. She asks nothing of any of us; she expects
      nothing, and yet she loves all of us. If he only would unbend toward her a
      little&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Lyddy dear. I don't believe it's altogether up to him. There is a
      barrier that we can't see, but they do, both of them. My mother stands
      between them. You see, I've come to know my father lately, dear. He's not
      a stranger to me any longer. I know what sort of a heart he's got. He
      never got over loving my mother, and he'll never get over knowing that
      Yvonne knows that <i>she</i> loved him to the day she died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know what it was in Yvonne that attracted him from the first, and she
      knows. He's not likely to forgive himself so easily. He didn't play fair
      with either of them, that's what I'm trying to get at. I don't believe he
      can forgive himself any more than he can forgive Yvonne for the thing she
      set about to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Lyddy, she married him without love. She debased herself, even
      though she can't admit it even now. I love her, too. She's the most
      wonderful woman in the world. But she did give herself to the man she
      hated with all her soul and&mdash;well, there you are. He can't forget <i>that</i>,
      you know, and she can't. She loves him for herself now, and that's what
      hurts both of them. It hurts because they both know that he still loves my
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's his wife, however,&rdquo; said Lydia, with a stubborn pursing of the
      lips. &ldquo;She didn't wrong him, and, after all, she's only guilty of&mdash;well,
      she isn't guilty of anything except being a sister of the girl <i>he</i>
      wronged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have a talk with him if you think best,&rdquo; said he, an eager gleam in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I with Yvonne,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;You see, it's possible she is the
      one to be persuaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you've observed that they never see one another alone,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;They never meet except when someone else is about. He rather resents
      the high-handed way in which she ordered him to stay away from me
      until I was safely out of danger. He says she saved my life. He says she
      performed a miracle. But he has never uttered a word of thanks or
      gratitude or appreciation to her. I'm sure of that, for she has told me
      so. And she is satisfied to go without his thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; she said with a sigh. &ldquo;I suppose we just can't
      understand things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've no idea how beautiful you are to-day, Lyddy,&rdquo; he cried
      suddenly, and she looked up into his glowing eyes with a smile of
      ineffable happiness. Her hand found his, and her warm, red lips were
      pressed to its palm in a hot, impassioned kiss. &ldquo;It's great to be alive!
      Great!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They might better have said that it is great to be young, for that is what
      it all came to in the analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on Brood joined them in the courtyard. He stood, with his hand on
      his son's shoulder, chatting carelessly about the coming voyage, all the
      while smiling upon the radiant girl to whom he was promising paradise. She
      adored the gentle, kindly gleam in those one-time steady, steel-like
      eyes. His voice, too, of late was pitched in a softer key, and there was
      the ring of happiness in its every note. It was as if he had discovered
      something in life that was constantly surprising and pleasing him. He
      seemed always to be venturing into fresh fields of exploration and finding
      there something that was of inestimable value to his new estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia left father and son after a few minutes, excusing herself on the
      ground that she wished to have a good, long chat with Yvonne. She did not
      delay her departure, but hurried into the house, having rather adroitly
      provided Frederic with an opening for an intercession in behalf of his
      lovely stepmother. Her meaning glance was not wasted on the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost no time in following up the advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, father, I don't like the idea of leaving Yvonne out in the
      cold, so to speak. It's pretty darned rough, don't you think? Down in your
      heart you don't blame her for what she started out to do, and, after all,
      she's only human. Whatever happened in the past we&mdash;well, it's all in
      the past. She&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood stopped him with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, I will try to explain something to you. You may be able to
      understand things better than I. I fell in love with her once because an
      influence that was not her own overpowered me. There was something of your
      mother in her. She admits that to be true, and I now believe it. Well,
      that something, whatever it was, is gone. She is not the same. Yvonne is
      Thérèse. She is not the woman I loved two months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor am I the boy you hated two months ago,&rdquo; argued Frederic. &ldquo;Isn't there
      a parallel to be seen there, father? I am your son. She is your wife. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was never a time when I really hated you, my son. I tried to, but
      that is all over. We will not rake up the ashes. As for my wife&mdash;well,
      I have tried to hate her. It is impossible for me to do so. She is a
      wonderful woman. But you must understand, on the other hand, that I do not
      love her. I did when she looked at me with your mother's eyes and spoke to
      me with your mother's lips. But she is not the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give yourself a chance, dad. You will come to love her for herself if
      only you will let go of yourself. You are trying to be hard. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Brood interrupted. His face was pale, his eyes grew dark with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you are saying, Frederic. Let us discontinue the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to be happy, I want&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be happy. I am happy. Have I not found out the truth? Are you not
      my beloved son? Are&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who convinced you of all that, sir? Who is responsible for your
      present happiness, and mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; exclaimed the father in some agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll regret it all your life if you fail her now, dad. Why, hang it
      all, you're not an old man! You are less than fifty. Your heart hasn't
      dried up yet. Your blood is still hot. And she is glorious. Give yourself
      a chance. You know that she's one woman in a million, and she's yours! She
      has made you happy, she can make you still happier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not old. I am far younger than I was fifteen years ago. That's
      what I am afraid of&mdash;this youth I really never possessed till now. If I
      gave way to it now I'd&mdash;well, I would be like putty in her hands. She
      could go on laughing at me, trifling with me, fooling me to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn't do that!&rdquo; exclaimed his son hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't blame you for defending her. It's right that you should. You are
      forgetting the one important condition, however. She can never reconcile
      herself to the position you would put her in if I permitted you to
      persuade me that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you one thing, father, that you ought to know, if you are so
      blind that you haven't discovered it for yourself. She loves you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very young, my boy.&rdquo; Brood shook his head and smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's to become of her? You are leaving her without a thought for her
      future. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy she is quite capable of arranging her future. As a matter of
      fact, she had arranged it pretty definitely before this thing happened.
      Leave it to her, Frederic. It is impossible for me to take her away with
      us. It is not to be considered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, but bear this in mind: Lydia loves Yvonne, and she's heart-broken.
      Now we'll talk about her, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia had as little success in her rather more tactful interview with
      Yvonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear, I am satisfied,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Everything has turned out as
      it should. The wicked enchantress has been foiled and virtue triumphs.
      Don't be unhappy on my account, Lydia. It will not be easy to say good-bye
      to you and Frederic, but&mdash;<i>là! là!</i> What are we to do? Now please
      don't speak of it again. Hearts are easily mended. Look at my husband&mdash;<i>aïe!</i>
      He has had his heart made over from top to bottom&mdash;in a rough
      crucible, it's true, but it's as good as new, you'll admit. In a way, I am
      made over, too. I am happier than I've ever been in my life. I'm in love
      with my husband, I'm in love with you and Frederic, and I am more than
      ever in love with myself. So there! Don't feel sorry for me. I shall have
      the supreme joy of knowing that not one of you will ever forget me or my
      deeds, good and bad. Who knows? I am still young, you know. Time has the
      chance to be very kind to me before I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That last observation lingered in Lydia's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But despite her careless treatment of the situation, Yvonne awaited with
      secret dread the coming of that hour when James Brood would say goodbye to
      her and, instead of turning her away from his house, would go out of it
      himself without a single <i>command</i> to her. He would not tell her that
      it was no longer her home, nor would he tell her that it was.

      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next day came, bright and sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship was to sail at noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock the farewells were being said. There were tears and
      heartaches, and there was fierce rebellion in the hearts of two of the
      voyagers. Yvonne had declined to go to the pier to see them off, and Brood
      was going away without a word to her about the future. That was manifest
      to the anxious, soul-tried watchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence they made their way out to the waiting automobile. As Brood was
      about to pass through the broad front door a resolute figure confronted
      him. For a moment master and man stared hard into each other's eyes, and
      then, as if obeying an inflexible command, the former turned to glance
      backward into the hallway. Yvonne was standing in the library door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sahib!</i>&rdquo; said the Hindu, and there was strange authority in his
      voice. &ldquo;Tell her, <i>sahib</i>. It is not so cruel to tell her as it would
      be to go away without a word. She is waiting to be told that you do not
      want her to remain in your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brood closed his eyes for a second, and then strode quickly toward his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne, they all want me to take you along with us,&rdquo; he said, his voice
      shaking with the pent-up emotion of weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met his gaze calmly, almost serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, of course, it is quite impossible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I understand, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not possible,&rdquo; he said, steadying his voice with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I thought it would be better to say good-bye here and
      not at the pier. We must have some respect for appearances, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He searched her eyes intently, looking for some sign of weakening on her
      part. He did not know whether to feel disappointed or angry at what he
      saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you would have gone if I had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not say it, James. You did not ask me, and I have not asked
      anything of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I go,&rdquo; he said nervously, &ldquo;I want to say this to you: I have no
      feeling of resentment toward you. I am able to look back upon what you
      would have done without a single thought of anger. You have stood by me in
      time of trouble. I owe a great deal to you, Yvonne. You will not accept my
      gratitude&mdash;it would be a farce to offer it to you under the
      circumstances. But I want you to know that I am grateful. You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, please. This is the moment for you to say that your home cannot be
      mine. I am expecting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never say that to you, Yvonne. You are my wife. I shall expect
      you to remain my wife to the very end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the first time, her eyes flew open with surprise. A bewildered
      expression came into them almost at once. He had said the thing she least
      expected. She put out her hand to steady herself against the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do&mdash;do you mean that, James?&rdquo; she said wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my property. You are bound to me. I do not intend that you shall
      ever forget that, Yvonne. I don't believe you really love me, but that is
      not the point. Other women have not loved their husbands, and yet&mdash;yet
      they have been true and loyal to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You amaze me!&rdquo; she cried, watching his eyes with acute wonder in her own.
      &ldquo;Suppose that I should refuse to abide by your&mdash;what shall I call
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decision is the word,&rdquo; he supplied grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will abide by it, that's all. I am leaving you behind without the
      slightest fear for the future. This is your home. You will not abandon
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I said that I would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall now tell you what I intend to do, and have intended to do
      ever since I discovered that I could think for myself and not for Matilde.
      I intend to stay here until you turn me out as unworthy. I love you,
      James. You may leave me here feeling very sure of that. I shall go on
      caring for you all the rest of my life. I am not telling you this in the
      hope that you will say that you have a spark of love in your soul for me.
      I don't want you to say it now, James. But you will say it to me one day,
      and I will be justified in my own heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>have</i> loved you. There was never in this world anything like the
      love I had for you. I know it now. It was not Matilde I loved when I held
      you in my arms. I know it now. I loved <i>you</i>; I loved your body, your
      soul&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; she cried out sharply. &ldquo;I was playing at love then. Now I love
      in earnest. You've never known love such as I can really give. I know you
      well, too. You love nobly, and without end. Of late I have come to believe
      that Matilde could have won out against your folly if she had been
      stronger, less conscious of the pain she felt. If she had stood her
      ground, here, against you, you would have been conquered. But she did not
      have the strength to stand and fight as I would have fought. To-day
      I love my sister none the less, but I no longer fight to avenge her
      wrongs. I am here to fight for myself. You may go away thinking that I am
      a traitor to her, but you will take with you the conviction that I am
      honest, and that is the foundation for my claim against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are not a traitor to her cause,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You are its
      lifelong supporter. You have done more for Matilde than&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than Matilde could have done for herself? Isn't that true? I have forced
      you to confess that you loved her for twenty-five years with all
      your soul. I have done my duty for her. Now I am beginning to take myself
      into account. Some day we will meet again and&mdash;well, it will not be
      disloyalty to Matilde that moves you to say that you love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a long time. When at last he spoke his voice was full of
      gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not love you, Yvonne. I cannot allow you to look forward to the
      happy ending that you picture. You say that you love me. I shall give you
      the opportunity to prove it to yourself, if not to me. I order you,
      Thérèse, to remain in this house until I come to set you free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him for a moment, and then an odd smile came into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prisoner serving her time? Is that it, my husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are here when I return, I shall have reason to believe that your
      love is real, that it is good and true and enduring. I am afraid of you
      now. I do not trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your sentence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it that if you like, Thérèse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My keepers? Who are they to be? The old men of the sea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your keeper will be the thing you call love,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect me to submit to this&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not intend to impose this condition upon you by word of mouth. I
      was going away without a word, but you would have received from Mr Dawes a
      sealed envelope as soon as the ship sailed. It contains this command in
      writing. He will hand it to you, of course, but now that you know the
      contents it will not be necessary to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you <i>do</i> come back, am I to hope for something more than
      your pardon and a release?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not promise anything,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a long breath and there was the light of triumph in her eyes.
      Laying her slim hand on his arm, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am content, James. I am sure of you now. You will find me here when you
      choose to come back, be it one year or twenty. Now go; they are waiting
      for you. Be kind to them, and tell to them all that you have just told me.
      It will make them happy. They love me, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they <i>do</i> love you,&rdquo; said he, putting his hands upon her
      shoulders. They smiled into each other's eyes. &ldquo;Good-bye, Thérèse. I
      <i>will</i> return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, James. No, do not kiss me. It would be mockery. Good
      luck, and God speed you home again.&rdquo; Their hands met in a warm, firm
      clasp. &ldquo;I will go with you as far as the door of my prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the open door she smiled out upon the young people in the motor and
      waved her handkerchief in gay farewell. Then she closed the door and
      walked slowly down the hallway to the big library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has taken the only way to conquer himself,&rdquo; she mused, half aloud. &ldquo;He
      is a wise man, a very wise man. I might have expected this of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled the bell-cord, and Jones came at once to the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Mr Dawes and Mr Riggs return from the ship, tell them that I shall
      expect them to have luncheon with me. That's all, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Jones, you may always set the table for three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jones blinked. He felt that he had never behaved so wonderfully in all the
      years of service as he did when he succeeded in bowing in his habitual
      manner, despite the fact that he was &ldquo;everlawstingly bowled over, so to
      speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For three, madam. Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cold, blustery night in January, six months after the beginning of
      Yvonne's voluntary servitude in the prison to which her husband had
      committed her. In the big library, before a roaring fire, sat the two old
      men, very much as they had sat on the December night that heralded the
      approach of the new mistress of the house of Brood, except that on this
      occasion they were eminently sober. On the corner of the table lay a long,
      yellow envelope, a cablegram addressed to Mrs James Brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been here for two hours, and she don't even think of opening it to
      see what's inside,&rdquo; complained Mr Riggs, but entirely without reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's her business, Joe,&rdquo; said Mr Dawes, pulling hard at his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe someone's dead,&rdquo; said Mr Riggs dolorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like as not, but what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it, you infernal&mdash;but, excuse me, Danbury, I won't say it.
      It's against the rules, God bless 'em. If anybody's dead, she ought to
      know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing nobody is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no use arguing with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll read it when she gets good and ready. At present she prefers to
      read the letters from Freddy and Lyddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it's from Jim,&rdquo; said his friend, a wistful look in his old eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I hope it is, by gee!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, and then they got up
      and went over to examine the envelope for the tenth time. &ldquo;I wish he'd
      telegraph or write, or do something, Dan. She's never had a line from him.
      Maybe this is something at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What puzzles me is that she always seems disappointed when there's
      nothing in the post from him, and here's a cablegram that might be the
      very thing she's looking for, and she pays no attention to it. It
      certainly beats me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what puzzles me more than anything else? I've said it a hundred
      times. She never goes outside this here house, except in the garden, day
      or night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sh&mdash;h!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Brood was descending the stairs, lightly, eagerly. In another instant
      she entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice the fire looks!&rdquo; she cried. Never had she been more radiantly,
      seductively beautiful. &ldquo;My cablegram, where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old men made a simultaneous dash for the long-neglected
      envelope. Mr Dawes succeeded in being the first to clutch it in his eager
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better read it, Mrs Brood,&rdquo; he panted, thrusting it into her hand. &ldquo;Maybe
      it's bad news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him with one of her most mysterious smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend, it is <i>not</i> bad news. It is good news; it's from my
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't read it,&rdquo; gasped Mr Riggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I know, just the same.&rdquo; She deliberately slit the envelope with a
      slim finger and held it out to them. &ldquo;Read it if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They solemnly shook their heads, too amazed for words. She unfolded the
      sheet and sent her eyes swiftly over the printed contents. Then, to their
      further stupefaction, she pressed the bit of paper to her red lips. Her
      eyes flashed like diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! Here is what he says: 'Come by the first steamer. I want you to
      come to me, Thérèse.' And see! It is signed 'Your husband.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; shouted the two old men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head slowly, &ldquo;I shall not obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You&mdash;you won't go?&rdquo; gasped Mr Riggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried, the ring of triumph in her voice. She suddenly clapped
      her hands to her breast and uttered a long, deep sigh of joy. &ldquo;No, I shall
      not go to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old men stared helplessly while she sank luxuriously into a big chair
      and stuck her little feet out to the fire. They felt their knees grow weak
      under the weight of their suddenly inert bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will come and unlock the door,&rdquo; she went on serenely. &ldquo;Ring for Jones,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha&mdash;what are you going to do?&rdquo; Mr Dawes had the temerity to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send a cablegram to my husband saying&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused to smile at the flaming logs on the broad hearth, a sweet,
      rapturous smile that neither of the old men could comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saying&mdash;what?&rdquo; demanded Mr Riggs anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I cannot go to him,&rdquo; she said, as she stretched out her arms toward
      the East.

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
